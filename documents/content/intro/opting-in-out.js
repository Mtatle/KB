SMS marketing is a powerful tool for engaging customers, but it comes with strict compliance requirements. To protect both businesses and consumers, marketing messages must be sent only to customers who have given explicit permission.
Failure to follow compliance guidelines can lead to legal risks, blocked messages, and loss of customer trust.
In this video, we‚Äôll cover: What SMS compliance is and why it mattersHow Attentive ensures every message follows regulationsWhat happens when a customer opts into SMS marketing How customers can easily unsubscribe (opt out) Real examples of the opt-in and opt-out process using Concierge

Importance of Compliance
Compliance in SMS marketing refers to adhering to legal and industry regulations that protect consumers from unwanted or unsolicited messages.
Why It Matters?
Prevents legal penalties and fines for non-compliance.
Builds customer trust by ensuring clear, transparent communication.
Protects brand reputation and prevents messages from being blocked by carriers.


How Attentive Ensures It!

The brand name, message terms, and privacy policies are transparent.
Customers have an easy way to stop messages at any time.
Customer data is securely stored and handled according to regulations.
Attentive‚Äôs tools are designed with the TCPA and CTIA in mind


SMS compliance ensures that businesses obtain clear, legal consent before sending marketing messages.
In simple terms, this means:
- Customers must actively agree to receive texts.
- Businesses must be transparent about what customers are signing up for.
- Customers must always have a clear way to opt out if they change their minds.
Following these principles isn‚Äôt just best practice - it‚Äôs a legal requirement that protects both businesses and customers.
Now, let‚Äôs talk about why compliance matters.
Firstly, It prevents legal penalties and fines
Businesses that send messages without proper consent risk significant fines and even lawsuits.
Next, it builds customer trust
Customers are more likely to engage with brands that respect their privacy and provide clear, transparent communication. A confusing or misleading opt-in process can make customers feel tricked and cause them to opt out immediately.
Also, it protects brand reputation
Mobile carriers and messaging platforms can block messages from businesses that don‚Äôt follow compliance guidelines. Brands that ignore compliance risk being flagged as spam, damaging their reputation.
Since compliance is so important, how does Attentive ensure every message follows the rules?
Attentive is designed to keep brands compliant at every step, ensuring that every text message meets legal requirements.
Here‚Äôs how Attentive does this:
Transparent message terms ‚Äì Customers clearly see what they‚Äôre agreeing to, which brand they‚Äôre signing up for - including message frequency and opt-out instructions.
 Easy opt-out process ‚Äì Customers can unsubscribe instantly by replying with a standard keyword like STOP.
Secure data handling ‚Äì Customer information is safely stored and managed in compliance with regulations.
 Built-in compliance tools ‚Äì Every opt-in flow is structured to meet legal standards and properly store consent records.
But what specific laws and industry standards does Attentive follow?
 The TCPA (Telephone Consumer Protection Act)
A federal law that protects consumers from unwanted marketing texts.
Requires express written consent before sending promotional SMS messages.
Violations can lead to major fines, even if messages were sent by mistake.
The CTIA Guidelines
These are industry best practices that help prevent spam and misleading messages.
Ensures customers receive clear disclosures and can unsubscribe easily.
By following these regulations, Attentive helps businesses send messages legally and responsibly.

Opt-In Process
The process where customers explicitly give consent to receive SMS marketing messages.
What Subscribers Are Agreeing To
Receiving recurring automated promotional messages

Varying message frequencies and send times

Acknowledgment that message and data rates may apply.


Clear Opt-Out instructions

Now that we‚Äôve covered compliance, let‚Äôs go over how customers opt in to receive SMS marketing messages.
Opting into SMS marketing means a customer has given clear, explicit permission to receive text messages from a brand. This consent is required by law and ensures that customers are fully aware of what they are signing up for.
But what exactly are subscribers agreeing to when they opt in?
- Receiving recurring automated promotional messages
These messages may include exclusive offers, product updates, and special promotions from the brand.
Messages are sent automatically based on customer interactions or marketing campaigns.
-Varying message frequencies
The number of messages received per month can change depending on promotions and marketing campaigns.
Customers must be made aware of message frequency expectations upfront and the varying times they might receive the messages..
-Acknowledgment that message and data rates may apply
Some mobile carriers may charge customers for receiving texts, so this must be clearly disclosed.
The standard phrasing is: ‚ÄúMsg & data rates may apply.‚Äù
-Clear opt-out instructions
Customers must be informed that they can unsubscribe at any time.
Common opt-out keywords like STOP, CANCEL, and UNSUBSCRIBE must be provided.

Opt-In Process
The process where customers explicitly give consent to receive SMS marketing messages.
Now let‚Äôs look at the complete process. 
Starting with methods subscribers can use to opt-in - we already touched on them in the previous video: these are Two Tap Sign-Up Unit, Sign-Up Prompt, Replying to SMS Campaigns or Texting a Phone Number.  Regardless of the method they use, they will be told exactly what they‚Äôre signing up for 
[Visual demo on the website] [back to slide]
Then once they‚Äôve consented, they‚Äôll be added to the brand‚Äôs SMS marketing list where they can get live agent support through Concierge and receive promotional text messaging through the campaigns, journeys and transactional messages.

Then finally, if at any point the customer feels they no longer want to be receiving SMSes from the brand, they can opt-out either by sending a key-word or by asking a live agent. Let‚Äôs look into how this process works.

Opt-Out Process
Opting In & Out 

Opt-Out Process
The process by which customers stop receiving marketing messages from a brand.
How Subscribers Can Opt-Out
By sending standard opt-out key-words (e.g. "STOP," "CANCEL," "END," "QUIT," "UNSUBSCRIBE".)
By communicating with a live agent that they wish to no longer receive text messages. 


What Happens Next?

The system or AI will automatically remove the customer from the brand‚Äôs text messaging list. 
The agent is required to immediately unsubscribe the customer. 
An automated message will be sent to the customer to confirm they‚Äôve unsubscribed and they will no longer receive any brand SMSes. 


Opting out of SMS marketing means a customer withdraws their consent to receive text messages from a brand. This ensures that customers have full control over their communication preferences and aligns with compliance regulations.
So, how can subscribers opt out, and what happens next?
1. By texting a keyword
Customers can opt out by replying with a designated keyword like STOP, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE, or END.
These keywords must be recognized immediately, triggering the system to remove the subscriber from future messages.
2. By directly requesting removal
Some customers may reach out to a live agent on Concierge to ask or imply that their number be removed from SMS marketing.
In these cases, the agent must immediately manually process the opt-out without further correspondence. 
Then once that‚Äôs done 
Subscribers will receive an automated confirmation message verifying their removal.
Once a customer has opted out, they must not receive any more promotional SMS messages unless they opt back in.
Attempting to message an opted-out subscriber can violate compliance regulations and lead to penalties.

Opt-Out Process
The process by which customers stop receiving marketing messages from a brand.
When Else Should a Customer Be Unsubscribed?
When the customer explicitly says they are younger than 13 years old
When a customer texts a variation of an opt-out keyword (‚ÄúZTOP‚Äù, ‚ÄúCNCL‚Äù, ‚ÄúENDS‚Äù, ‚ÄúQWIT‚Äù, ‚ÄúINSUBSCRIB‚Äù)
When a customer texts any of these emojis - üõë‚õîÔ∏è‚úã


How To Unsubscribe?
There are situations where customers don‚Äôt need to explicitly request to be unsubscribed for us to opt them out. To uphold compliance and maintain a professional, ethical environment, we proactively unsubscribe customers in specific cases, including:
If a customer states that they are under 13 years old. We do not ask or investigate a customer‚Äôs age‚Äîthis must be something they disclose on their own.
If a customer sends any variation of an opt-out keyword, even with typos. If it's clear they intended to unsubscribe, we process the request immediately.
If a customer uses emojis that clearly indicate ‚Äústop‚Äù or an intent to opt out.
There are additional scenarios where unsubscribing is necessary, which you‚Äôll learn more about in later training.
Next, let‚Äôs take a look at how to unsubscribe a customer‚Ä¶
