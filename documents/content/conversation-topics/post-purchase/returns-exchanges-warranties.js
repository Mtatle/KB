Return & Exchanges Overview

Returns & Exchanges/Warranties
Warranty Policy
Damaged/Broken Items

When a warranty claim is submitted, the brand reviews the request to confirm the issue is due to a manufacturing defect or malfunction, not due to misuse, accidental damage, or unauthorized modifications
The Warranty Process
The claim process begins with collecting essential information: photos of the issue, proof of purchase, and a detailed description of the problem
If a claim does not meet the warranty criteria, the brand explains the specific exclusions and, when appropriate, may consider additional goodwill measures.
Once verified against the warranty terms, the brand determines the appropriate resolution, which may include repairing the product, offering a replacement, or issuing a refund
How Warranty Works

Warranties are a type of assurance or guarantee that brands offer to customers, but they can take many forms. They don’t always have to be explicitly labeled as a warranty
Types of Warranties
Traditional Warranties
Satisfaction Guarantees
These are formal warranties where a brand promises to repair, replace, or refund a product within a specific period (e.g., "1-Year Warranty").
Often not called a “warranty,” but they serve a similar purpose. Examples:
“30-Day Money-Back Guarantee”
“100% Satisfaction or Your Money Back”
Repairs or Replacements
This is common in categories like jewelry or tech:
“Free resizing or repairs for 1 year.”
“Replace damaged items once for free.”

Defect
Malfunctions
These are problems that occur due to faulty materials or workmanship. For example, if a device has a component that fails because of poor manufacturing, it falls under warranty coverage
Issues where the product does not operate as intended under normal conditions. This might include performance failures or operational errors that are not due to misuse
Warranty Coverage outlines exactly what the warranty protects and the most common types of coverage:
Warranty Coverage

Limited Warranty
Lifetime Warranty
Some products come with warranties valid for a set period, such as 1 or 2 years. This period is defined in the warranty documentation
Some warranties last for the product’s “lifetime” — a term that may be defined differently by each brand (e.g., the useful life of the product)
The duration of a warranty determines how long the item is protected
Warranty Coverage

Physical harm from drops, spills, or collisions not covered by the standard warranty
Repairs or alterations by unapproved parties or changes that deviate from the original design
Using the product outside of recommended guidelines or for unintended purposes
Misuse
Warranties are not all-inclusive; there are specific exclusions that void warranty claims
Accidental Damage
Unauthorized Modification
Common Exclusions
Warranty Exclusions

To provide accurate information about the product’s warranty
Use the wp temp
Some brands may have their own warranty policies detailed in a dedicated warranty template or on their website
What is your warranty of products?
Pre-purchase FAQs

And include the wp temp
We give information about coverage from the warranty page
Sometimes, the warranty policy template doesn’t include the coverage and just refers to the website, but the customer wants specific information
What exactly does the warranty cover?
In these cases, we go to the brand’s warranty page and find what the warranty covers and provide it to the customer along with the warranty page link for additional info
Pre-purchase FAQs

And share it with the customer
We find the warranty claim request on the website
My product broke after 2 years, what do I do?
We don’t handle warranty claims directly. That’s why we refer the customer to submit a warranty claim to get assistance from the brand
Keep in mind, some brands offer warranties but don’t have a claim form on their site and they may ask customers to email instead. In those cases Escalate or Send to CS per notes
Warranty Claims

We collect details and then escalate or send to CS if the brand doesn’t allow escalations
We search on the website if the brand offers any sort of happiness guarantee and inform the customer
Search for guarantees
Some companies don’t offer any warranty coverage on their products. This means there’s no formal promise for repair, replacement, or refund based solely on product defects.

Damaged/Broken Items
After receiving the information, proceed to escalate 
We apologize and request details using the DMI template
My order arrived and the product is broken!
The customer contacts us to report that they received an item that is broken, damaged or defective
Keep in mind that the customer received the item in this condition; they did not cause the damage themselves
If we don’t allow escalations for a client, we send the customer to CS and apologize for the inconvenience instead
