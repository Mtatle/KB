 Code Applied to Cancelled Order

Identify the Request
Is the customer asking to:
Cancel their order?
Change their shipping address?
Edit order details?
Do NOT use this workflow for retroactive discount requests. See the separate retroactive discount deck 
If they are, we have a Cancel/Edit request!




That is available in the UI



Such as notes, or brand resources when necessary



By reviewing the order's tracking information
Key Steps
Once we’ve identified that there’s a request, there are a few key steps we need to follow:
Confirm if the order has already been shipped
Review the relevant CED template
Check any brand-specific information
 After going through these three steps, we’ll be in a good position to respond appropriately

Checking Order Tracking
Why check if an order has already been shipped?
Once an order has shipped, most brands cannot make changes or cancel
If a customer requests an edit or cancellation after shipment, we will not follow the CED template in that case. Unless brand-specific information specifically instructs us to do so. Even if the template suggests escalation or sending to CS

How to Check Order Tracking
Keep in mind that the order confirmation page may not always display the most up-to-date information, as shown in this example. Always check tracking information as well when it’s possible to do so
Order details will be available on the left hand side of the UI
Check whether a tracking number or link is available
If a tracking number is available, it typically indicates that the package is already out for delivery meaning, in most cases, it can no longer be canceled or edited

If the Order Has not Shipped
If the notes or templates indicate that we should send the case to CS
We should follow through and send the customer to CS. Starting of by apologizing, and usually providing the ced template
If the order has not yet shipped / there are no shipping details available, and no brand restrictions apply 
If notes or templates instruct us to gather information
Check Customer Information for an order #, apologize to the customer, and prepare for an escalation usually using the ced template

If the Order Has Shipped
Based on the Customer's request we will either
Cancellations & Edits
Shipping Address Changes
Apologize and let the customer know the order is already on its way
Explain that orders in transit can’t be canceled/edited
Advise the customer to return if possible
Let the customer know the brand likely can’t update the address
Suggest they contact the courier for a delivery change

If they push back in either scenario, we’ll escalate or send to CS per the CED template

Workflow Exceptions
However, brand-specific information can overrule this workflow. If the information indicates:
They allow changes/cancellations after shipment in the notes or templates
Follow the brand’s rules, and respond accordingly
These issues require immediate escalation / sending to CS

In some cases, the brand may not allow any edits or cancellations at all. If that’s the case, it will be clearly stated in the CED template
Always review any notes associated with the scenario as well!
If the template clearly states that cancellations and edits are not allowed:
Politely inform them using the CED template
Suggest they wait and process a return if viable
Directly apologize to the customer

Checking Brand FAQ/Policies
If there is no brand-specific information available in the UI
Default to the notes & templates, but use FAQ as a last resort
We are supposed to check if any information is available on the website regarding Canceling and Editing orders
If you find any information share it with the customer and request a template

Code Applied to Cancelled Order
A customer reaches out wanting to reuse a discount code from a previous order that they either cancelled or returned
Empathize with the customer if appropriate
Let the customer know that the code may not work because it was already used on their previous order
Check the UI for any active discount codes that provide the same discount
If available, share these alternative codes with the customer
If no equivalent codes exist, follow the notes and either:
Escalate the request
Send the Customer to CS
Step 1
Step 2
Be transparent and polite in your response
Step 3
Step 4

Reminders
If notes say we should send to CS, don’t escalate
Add empathy phrases when responding to a Cancel/Edit request
Suggest a return or exchange when applicable if brand doesn’t allow cancellations/edits
Adjust the CED template as needed and remove any sections that don’t apply
