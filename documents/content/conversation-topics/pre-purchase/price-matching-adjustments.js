We share the correct template and edit it accordingly
Confirm the product the customer is referring to
Keep the tone helpful and neutral mirroring the customer
If the brand hasn’t provided specific instructions, this is a good message to use because:

Non-compliance Example
We miss the required empathy
Dismiss the customer’s concern without offering help
Don’t make use of any brand information
If the brand doesn’t allow Price Adjustments, this message needs improvement because:

A Retroactive Request is made when a customer would like to receive credit back after they have already made a purchase.
The customer pays full price first, and the discount is applied later, usually when specific conditions are met.
What are Retroactive Requests?
Retroactive Requests

Retroactive Requests
 Check Notes in the agent UI
Check If it’s allowed 
Check if the customer is eligible
Sometimes, customers make a purchase then realize that they either forgot to apply a promo code or want to swap it for a different one
When this happens, we follow a specific process to handle their request properly. First steps to take are:
 Look in Templates – Use rdr shortcut
Check their previous orders to see if they’ve already used the same code or a different code with the same or higher value
Check the order they want to apply the code to, and test if the code is applicable by creating a mock cart

Retroactive Requests
Once we have validated that it’s possible to apply the code we can:
Use the “rdr” template to:
Adding a code retroactively is not the same as editing an order, merchants can refund the difference without modifying the order. Do not use the “CED” template for these cases
If there are any brand-specific requirements in the templates or notes we must follow them!
Keep in mind
Always check if the customer sent in any details and edit the template accordingly!
Collect the order details
Get the promo code details
Escalate the request for approval

Keep In Mind
Our internal notes and templates come directly from the brand. These are the most accurate and up-to-date instructions for handling customer requests
Even if the website says something different, always follow the notes or templates first
