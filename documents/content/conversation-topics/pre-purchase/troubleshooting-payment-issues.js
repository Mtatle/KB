Two Different Cards

Payment issues are problems that can occur during checkout or after a purchase. They include problems like a declined card, duplicate charges, or a payment not showing up. 
We review the details, ask clear questions, and explain the steps to fix the issue. This helps us solve problems quickly and keeps our customers satisfied

Declined Cards
Use the mtch template first

Verifying the billing address and zip code match the card details
Testing a different browser if needed
If these steps don’t resolve the issue

Escalate or direct the customer to CS based on the provided notes

Declined Cards
For Shopify brands, if the shipping address is different from the billing address, it may cause issues because Shopify automatically sets them as the same
If We Suspect This is The Case
Ask the customer if their shipping and billing addresses match
1
If not, tell them to uncheck the "Use Shipping Address as Billing Address" option

Prepaid Cards
Inform the customer that their prepaid card isn’t accepted
Suggest using a credit card or an alternative payment method
Sometimes customers attempt to use prepaid cards at checkout. While some prepaid cards work, others may be rejected due to restrictions or compatibility issues with our payment system
How to Handle a Prepaid Card Issue
Apologize and send the pcr template

Only Paypal Available
Explain they can still use a card even if PayPal is the only option shown
By choosing Paypal at checkout, paying with a card through the service, however without logging in
Sometimes customers only see PayPal as the payment option, but they want to pay directly with a credit or debit card instead
How to Help When Only Paypal is Available
We send the ppl template

Pending Charge
If there’s no email confirmation, the order likely did not go through
The pending charge will usually revert within 24–48 hours, or process successfully 
Sometimes a customer reaches out because they see a pending charge on their payment method, but haven’t received an email confirmation from the brand. They’re unsure whether the order was successfully placed
How to Help When There’s a Pending Charge
Use the cp template

Two Different Cards
Explain split payments aren’t supported, however the workaround being buy a online gift card
Using the gift card at checkout + paying the rest with the second card
Customers sometimes want to use two different cards at the same time to pay for a single order, but the checkout process doesn't support that directly
How to Help a Customer Use Multiple Cards
We guide them using the dcc template
If the brand doesn’t offer online gift cards we would educate the customer about the limitation and thank them for their feedback
