 How Do We Drive to Purchase?
I totally understand! What do you think about this dress instead? It’s super light and soft! [link]
I like it, but I’m not sure if I love the material, it’s quite rough...
The dress you liked is back in stock! It’s perfect for summer. Let me know what you think!
Focus on these soft skills to effectively encourage purchases 

Use of persuasive, non-pushy language
Building rapport
Highlight product value
Encouraging Customers to Purchase
Always backread the conversation to ensure you understand their needs & context. 
Always insert a link to relevant resources, products, or services 
KEY TIP!

 When TO Drive to Purchase?
Customers often welcome helpful, relevant product suggestions, especially when they’re already exploring or asking about items. A well-timed D2P message can improve their experience and guide them to something they love
They’re already showing purchase intent, help them get there by sharing a relevant product page or collection link
It’s a good time to D2P when:
The customer asks about a product
You resolved their issue
They’re browsing, but undecided
If the customer is clearly shopping around but unsure, you can guide them gently with a collection page, bestsellers, or filtered link
Once their question has been answered or issue is resolved, it’s okay to recommend something, especially if it relates to what they were asking about

If a customer asks about a sold-out or unavailable product we would send the appropriate template and offer a similar in-stock alternative.
Whenever we provide the customer with a discount code or similar offer, we would redirect the customer so a specific product page or collection so they can make use of the discount
 When TO Drive to Purchase?
When a customer directly asks us to suggest a product, we would share a specific product link that aligns with the customer’s needs, and build value by explaining how and why this option is the most beneficial choice for them.
It’s a good time to D2P when:
Asking  for a Recommendation
Product Out of Stock
Providing the Customer a Discount

 When NOT to Drive to Purchase?
Customers appreciate brands that don’t always push for a sale. Being respectful and empathetic strengthens our brand’s image. Customers are more likely to return if they feel valued, not pressured. Too many sales-driven messages can lead to opt-outs or disengagement
If the chat is escalated and the customer hasn’t received a resolution yet, do not D2P
Avoid D2P messages when:
The chat has been escalated
When the message is a close/block
The customer is frustrated 
If the customer is complaining and has questions not related to products, it might not be appropriate to D2P
If the message prompts an unsub, close or a block based on our workflow, avoid D2P

 Best Practices
Browsing history
Customers messages in the thread based of UI conversations 
Identify Intent 
Holidays (Christmas, BFCM, Valentine’s)
Promotions (Sales, discount upsell)
Product launches
Use Triggers
Emphasize how the product solves a problem or enhances the customer’s experience.
Use storytelling, e.g. "Stay cozy this winter with our ultra-soft blankets!" 
Build Rapport

Sharing Links

Always copy links fully from the browser’s address bar
Paste them exactly as they are - no extra characters before or after
How to Share Links
Punctuation that won’t affect link functionality:   .  ,  : ? ! 
The Right Way to Copy & Paste!
ctrl + c
ctrl + v

Double-Checking Links
Some websites don’t change URLs when interacting with buttons, filters, or navigation tools, meaning the copied link won’t lead to the same page
If you use a dash to separate a link: "You can check out - ", make sure there is a space between the dash and the link
A properly copied and tested link ensures a smooth customer experience and prevents confusion! 🚀
Common Issues to Avoid
It loads correctly
It’s the correct website
It’s the correct region
It directs to the exact page we intend
Before sharing, always open the link in a new tab to confirm:

Relevant Links
When assisting customers, your goal is to provide highly relevant product links that align with their needs and preferences
Ensure that the product you send matches all the details they have provided (e.g. size, color, type)
Consider the Context
If they mention they are looking for discounts or budget-friendly options, avoid sending high-priced products unless they are the only option that fits their specific request
Factor in Budget
Customers appreciate genuine and thoughtful recommendations
Look for cues in their messages, use everything to your advantage to guide them toward the best choice
Be Their Shopping Friend
Often, a customer’s request is connected to a journey message we’ve previously sent (e.g. a promotional offer or new collection drop)
Backreading helps!
Backread

Best Practices
Simple questions help narrow down their preferences:
What size are you looking for?
Do you prefer any specific color or style?
Ask clarifying questions if you’re unsure
Never send a plain link, always provide context. Keep it short, clear, and engaging!
Since you’re looking for lightweight sneakers, here’s our latest breathable collection: [link]
Personalize every link you send
After sharing a link, engage with the customer to ensure it meets their needs:
Did you find what you were looking for?
Would you like any other options?
Follow up after sending the link

The Perfect Recommendation 
As an agent, it’s important to provide relevant links, but you don’t need to overthink every recommendation. Your goal is to quickly find an option that matches what the customer is looking for not necessarily the most "perfect" item on the entire website
Instead, focus on key details the customer has mentioned. If a product aligns with their request, send it confidently rather than delaying the conversation
Acknowledge the limitation and apologize. Give them an option that meets most of their criteria. And use your sales skills! Highlight the benefits of the alternative product and encourage them to consider it
Don’t waste time over-browsing!
 If we can’t find exactly what they want…

Recommendation Examples

General Links

When to Use General Links
Happy Customer
Sales Opportunity
By integrating general recommendation links effectively, we can subtly encourage purchases while offering a seamless and enjoyable experience
When a customer isn't looking for anything in particular, but the conversation presents an opportunity to drive to purchase, we provide a general recommendation link that allows them to explore options at their own pace

Relevant General Links
Which link do I choose?
New Arrivals
When sharing general recommendation links to drive to purchase, there is no fixed rule on which link to share. The goal is always to provide the most relevant link based on the context of the conversation. However, some links are more commonly used than others in general browsing situations particularly at the end of conversations
Bestsellers
Sales Page

What Are Bestsellers?
Bestsellers are highly popular, frequently purchased, or trending products with strong reviews and consistent demand. That’s why our bestsellers link is our main reference for general recommendations
In the meantime, you might enjoy checking out our bestsellers. These are some of our most popular and trending items right now! You can explore them here: [Bestsellers Page]
Example: ✨
Why do we share this link first?
It appeals to undecided shoppers who may not know what they’re looking for
It creates credibility, showing customers what others are buying and loving
It’s a great starting point for browsing, as it presents the most sought-after items

What Are New Arrivals?
If there are no clear bestsellers, the next best option are New Arrivals, the latest products added to the store. These could be seasonal releases, updated designs, or entirely new product lines
We’ve just added some exciting new items to our collection. You can check out all our latest arrivals here: [New Arrivals Page]. Let me know if you have any favorites!
Example: ✨
Why share the New Arrivals?
Customers who like to stay ahead of trends may prefer the newest products
It creates a sense of exclusivity and excitement
It’s great for returning customers who may have already seen the bestsellers and want something fresh

What Is the Sales Page?
A Sales Page is a dedicated section where discounted items and deals are showcased. Unlike bestsellers or new arrivals, this page is specific to customers looking for the best price
The rewards page (if they are eligible for loyalty benefits)
A cheaper item that meets their needs
Any available bundle deals or promotions
When do we share the Sales Page?
When a customer asks about discounts, promo codes, deals, or is generally looking for good value,  if no promo code is available,this becomes the best alternative
If there is no sales page, we provide alternative discount options such as:

Links to the Homepage
One of the most common cases is providing a customer with a coupon code
When guiding customers to purchase, we typically avoid sharing a link to the homepage. Instead, we prioritize directing them to pages that are more relevant to their needs
Although we generally avoid it, there are exceptions where linking to the homepage actually helps the customer
Why don’t we share links to the Homepage?
When can we share links to the Homepage?
If we share a coupon code with a customer, we must always add a link directing them to the website
We may share the homepage link because that’s where they need to start their shopping journey
The homepage is too broad and not tailored to the customer’s specific inquiry
Customers may feel lost or overwhelmed if they are dropped on the homepage without clear direction
It creates an extra step, forcing them to navigate to the correct page on their own

Using Text Blaze Shortcuts
One of the best ways to save time and improve efficiency is by using Text Blaze shortcuts. If you share a general link more than 3 times a day, setting up a shortcut in Text Blaze will streamline the process! However, keep in mind that we still need to double-check the validity of the links before sending
This is especially useful for brands like Snipes, where we often have to wait for authentication before accessing links. Having them stored as Text Blaze snippets eliminates that delay
 Use case
Simply typing in a shortcut and the full message with the correct link appears instantly!

Specific Links

What Are Specific Links?
Specific links refer to direct links that lead customers to the products they are specifically looking for. Unlike general links, which encourage browsing, specific links streamline the purchasing process by guiding the customer directly to what they had in mind
Reduce decision fatigue by presenting relevant options
Save time by leading customers directly to products that meet their criteria
Customers who need specific links usually have a clearer idea of what they want but may need guidance in making a final selection. These links help:

Product Pages
A Product Page takes the customer directly to a single product they are interested in
Why send a Product Page?
However, we avoid sending only a product page link unless we are:
100% sure it’s the exact item they want (e.g. they provided an image of the item)
Providing an alternative if their requested item is unavailable

I’m looking for the Patsy Red Cowboy Boot. Do you have it?

Filtered Links
A Filtered Link is a direct URL that leads a customer to a customized product listing based on specific criteria, instead of directing a customer to a broad category or collection
What is a Filtered Link?
Filtered Links narrow down products to match their preferences, making it easier and faster for them to find what they want

Most e-commerce websites have broad product categories like:
✅    TVs
✅    Clothes
✅    Fridges
To set up a filtered link we first need to start with a product category
Starting with a General Category
How to use Filtered Links?
 If a customer lands on a general category page (e.g. "All TVs"), they will see hundreds or thousands of products, which can be overwhelming.
🔗 https://www.example.com/tvsThis page includes all available TVs with no filtering applied

Customers usually have some specific criteria in mind when shopping. Filters help refine the product list by eliminating irrelevant options
Applying Filters
Common filter categories include:
For Electronics
Brand 
Size 
Budget 
For Fashion
Size
Color 
Material 
How to use Filtered Links?

Once the filters are applied, the website updates the URL to reflect the selected criteria. This filtered link can then be shared with the customer, directing them only to products that match their requirements
Generating a Filtered Link
Now, instead of browsing through hundreds of TVs, the customer sees only LG TVs that are 65” and OLED, exactly what they asked for!
How to use Filtered Links?
Example of a Filtered Link for LG 65” TVs: 
https://www.example.com/tvs?brand=LG&size=65

Unknown Products 
Sometimes a customer will reference a product we have no information on. It could be something they saw weeks ago, a physical store item, or just a vague description
Helping Customers Find a Product
In these cases, our job isn’t to guess or assume. It’s to guide the customer through the search by asking helpful, non-repetitive questions that get us closer to the answer
I’m looking for a shirt that had Popeye on it, can you help me?
We don’t know what shirt they’re referring to, and we can’t find it through standard searches. So instead of saying “I’m not sure” or sending a random guess, we proactively steer the conversation

Unknown Products 
Here are some quick things you can ask for:
Screenshot or photo of the item
Where they saw it (email, website, social media, etc.)
Any colours, logos, or other design details
SKU, style code, or product ID 
How to Probe Effectively
I’m looking for a shirt that had Popeye on it, can you help me?
Happy to help! Do you happen to remember where you saw it? Maybe on social media or in an email? If you have a screenshot or any other details, I can take a closer look

Unknown Products 
If a customer sends you a screenshot or photo of a product they’re trying to find, and you don’t recognise it, you can use Google Images to try and identify it
Using Google Images
Right click on the image and copy it
Go to images.google.com
Click the camera icon in the search bar
Paste the image
How to Use Google Images
?
Note: Only share a product if you can find it on the brand’s official website

Website Reference Links

What Are Website Links?
These are direct links to pages on the brand’s website that help customers resolve their issues or understand a policy
Return Policy Page
Common Types of Website Reference Links
Return Portal
Warranty Details 
Size Charts
Loyalty or rewards program
Brand’s return/exchange policies and refund periods
Portal for submitting order-based return or exchange requests
Warranty coverage terms and claim procedures
Points accrual system and reward redemption options
Style-specific measurement tables for accurate sizing

Funnel Method

What Is the Funnel Method?
We want to:
Help in case they want options (by using filtered links)
Assist in case they don’t prefer to browse (by sending a product page)
Clarify their preferences to give more specific recommendations
The approach we take to handle this is called the Funnel Method
When dealing with customers looking for a recommendation we usually will find the need to combine both filtered links and product pages 
 Narrow Down with Filters
Recommend Specific Products  
Ask Questions 
Ask Questions 
 Start Broad 

Start Broad
Example questions to ask on step 1:
Are you looking for a specific brand?
What size and resolution are you looking for?
Do you have a certain budget in mind?
The customer may not yet know exactly what they want
Why?
How do we Help?
Instead of assuming, we ask open-ended questions to understand their preferences
1
Provide a link to a general category so they can explore
2
At this stage, the customer likely has a general idea of what they want but hasn’t given us specific details
A customer is looking for an LG TV, but hasn’t mentioned size, resolution, or any features
Prompt:

"Here’s a link to our full range of LG TVs: [General TV Page]. Do you have any specific preferences for screen size, resolution, or features?"

Agent Example:
1


We can remove irrelevant options and guide them toward a better fit
Why?
How do we Help?
Send a Filtered Link based on size, resolution, or any other preferences shared
1
Continue to ask specific details to show them the most relevant options
2
Now that we have some basic information, we use filters to refine their search
Narrow Down with Filters
Example questions to ask on step 2:
Do you prefer 4K or 8K resolution?
Are you looking for OLED, QLED, or LED options?
The customer says they want a 65-inch 4K TV
Prompt:
"Got it! Here’s a list of all our LG 65-inch 4K TVs: [Filtered Link]. Would you like OLED or LED?"
Agent Example:
1


The customer is now ready to pick a final product
Why?
How do we Help?
Share direct product pages of one or two recommended items
1
At this stage we build value, and ask confirmation questions to ensure it meets their needs
2
Now that we’ve narrowed it down, we can provide a product page link for one or two of the best options
Recommend Specific Products 
Example Questions to Ask at Step 3:
This model has OLED technology, which gives the best picture quality. Does that sound good to you?
Would you like to see similar models, or does this one meet your needs?
The customer says they prefer OLED TVs
Prompt:
"I’d recommend the LG C3 OLED 65” TV it’s one of our best-selling models! You can check it out here: [Product Page Link]. Let me know if you need more details!"
Agent Example:

Stock Issues

 What Are Stock Issues?
When an item is out of stock, your goal is to inform the customer efficiently while keeping them engaged with alternative options
Supply chain delays affecting restocks
Stock issues occur when a product a customer wants is temporarily or permanently unavailable for purchase. This can happen due to:
High demand leading to sold-out inventory
The item being discontinued by the brand

Check if the product page has a "Notify Me When Available" feature
How to Handle Stock Issues
Always provide an alternative product, even if the “Restock” template doesn’t explicitly state it. This ensures the customer has another option to consider instead of leaving empty-handed

Item is Not Available on the Site
When a customer inquires about an item that is not available at all on the website

"I'm sorry for any inconvenience! Unfortunately, we don’t carry that item at the moment, but I’ll definitely pass your feedback along to the team to consider it for the future. Thank you for letting us know! In the meantime, I found a similar option that I think you might like. Here’s the link: [link]. Let me know what you think!"

Agent Example:
          Apologize for the Inconvenience
Show empathy and acknowledge their request
          Appreciate Their Feedback
Let them know their interest is valuable and that you’ll pass their request along to the team
          Provide an Alternative Product
Even if the requested item is unavailable, always suggest a similar product that they might like

Upselling

Provide tailored recommendations that align with each customer’s needs
What is Upselling?
Goals for Upselling
Upselling means offering complementary or additional products to a customer after they've made a purchase or once their issue has been resolved. It's our way of helping them discover extra options that can enhance their overall experience
Focus on suggestions that truly help the customer
Offer additional products that add genuine value over time
Enhance Experience
Increase Value
Customer Focus

Upselling Approach
Our approach is simple: resolve first, then recommend. By prioritizing the customer’s immediate needs and offering relevant add-ons, we ensure a seamless, value-driven experience for both the customer and our client
Our Upselling Approach
?
Ensure the customer's main concern is fully addressed before offering additional options
Resolve First
Capture Every Opportunity
Once the primary issue is resolved, proactively share relevant links to benefit the customer
Use customer insights and context to suggest complementary products or collections
Personalize Recommendations
Leverage your understanding of each client's product lineup to provide tailored, informed recommendations
Know the Product
?

Most Common Scenarios:
When to Upsell?
Recommend complementary or upgraded products that build on their initial choice
Customer Has Completed a Purchase
When the issue is resolved, it's the perfect time to suggest upsell products 
Issue Resolved
Provide additional recommendations or collections aligned with their preferences
Customer Seeks More Options
Upselling works best when a customer's main need is met, mainly after a purchase or issue resolution. Providing an ideal moment to introduce complementary products that add genuine value

Customer Seeks More Options

When NOT to Upsell
If the customer is frustrated or clearly not open to sales, avoid pushing offers and focus on maintaining a positive experience
If the customer is frustrated or dissatisfied
If the upsell does not add genuine value
If the conversation should be about support, not sales
If the suggested product doesn’t truly benefit the customer, don’t force the sale—stay supportive and address their needs first
If the customer shares bad news or appears distressed, show empathy and avoid sales pitches, prioritizing compassion over conversion

Present upsell options as friendly, optional enhancements rather than must-have add-ons, keeping the conversation relaxed and customer-driven
Listen attentively and understand the customer's unique needs, ensuring they feel genuinely heard before suggesting any upgrades
Rely on your intuition and the subtle cues from the customer to decide if and when an upsell opportunity is appropriate
Best Practices
No Pressure
Respect & Empathy
Trust Your Gut
Upselling should always feel natural and supportive. Our goal is to enhance the customer experience by offering extra value only when it feels right—not by pushing additional sales
