This guide provides clarity on different customer incentive types (reward points, store credits, gift cards) and outlines the standard procedures for assisting customers with viewing, redeeming, and troubleshooting issues related to them.


Understanding the Differences


It's crucial to distinguish between these common incentive types as the workflows for handling customer issues vary.
  
  
  

Reward Points 
	Store Credit 
	   Gift Cards & E-Gift Cards 
	Source: Earned by customers through loyalty program actions (purchases, reviews, birthdays, social sharing, etc.
	Source: Issued by the brand, often for returns not eligible for a cash refund, as compensation for issues, or as a goodwill gesture
	Source: Usually purchased by a customer or someone else for the customer. Can sometimes be issued promotionally
	Form: Points accumulated in a customer's account
	Form: A specific monetary value linked to a customer, often delivered via email as a code
	Form: A specific monetary value, either as a physical card or an e-gift card delivered via email with a code
	Redemption: Usually redeemed via the customer's online profile for specific rewards. Redemption often generates a unique, one-time use discount code
	Redemption: Applied at checkout, usually like a gift card or unique discount code
	Redemption: Code is entered at checkout


	Use: Typically applied like a discount code during checkout; often cannot be combined with other promotions
	Use: Generally used like cash towards a purchase; typically has fewer restrictions (like minimum purchase) than promotional discount codes
	Use: Functions like cash towards a purchase. Policies vary on combining with discounts (check brand specifics)


	

Important Note on Terminology


Brands may use different terms interchangeably. For instance, some might refer to their points program as a "loyalty credit" system, while others use "credit" strictly for store credit. Always check the specific brand's website (Rewards/FAQ pages) to understand their terminology and use the correct terms when speaking with customers. 


If a brand uses the same term ambiguously for both reward points and store credit, and you are unsure what the customer is referring to, politely ask them to clarify (e.g., "Just to make sure I'm looking at the right thing, are you referring to the points you earn from purchases, or a store credit issued for a return?").


Handling Reward Points


Customers earn points for loyalty and need to access and use them easily.


1. How Customers View Points


* Usually available within the customer's online profile/account.
* Customers must be logged in.
* Often accessed via a "Rewards" section or a specific launcher icon (e.g., "shopping bag on the lower left").


2. How Customers Redeem Points

* Redemption is typically done from the customer's rewards profile after logging in.
* Customers select the reward they want, which often converts points into a redemption code (discount code).
* Instructions are usually on the brand's Rewards or FAQ page.

  

   * Note on Stacking Promotions: While redeemed reward codes often cannot be stacked with other promotions, this can vary by brand. Always double-check the brand's Notes, their Rewards FAQ page, or any specific terms associated with the reward before definitively stating they cannot be combined.
Troubleshooting Reward Points
1. Customer Cannot See Points
   * Ask: "Are you currently logged into your account associated with our rewards program?"
   * Guide & Check Expiry: If they are logged in, first provide the template/instructions on where to find points (see "How Customers View Points" above) to ensure they are looking in the correct place. Also, check the brand's Notes or Rewards FAQ page to see if points have an expiration period, as this could be why they are not visible.
   * Investigate Further: If they've checked the correct location and points aren't expired (or no expiry info is available), then ask if they've made recent purchases/actions that should have earned points.
   * Escalate if Necessary: If points genuinely seem to be missing after these checks, gather account details and escalate.

2. Customer Asking How to Redeem
   * Send the appropriate template (if available) or check the website/FAQ for redemption steps. Usually, the templates have specific instructions on how to redeem points.
   * Ask: "Are you logged into your account?"
   * Inform them that redeeming points usually generates a code to use at checkout.
   * If they redeemed but didn't get a code: Advise them to check their email (including spam/promo folders) and reload the rewards page.
   * Escalate if Unresolved: If the customer has followed all the above steps and they still cannot redeem their points, OR if points were deducted but no code/reward was received, then get their account details and escalate the issue. This applies whether points were visibly deducted or not, as long as the redemption process is failing after proper troubleshooting

3. Reward Redemption Code Not Working
Treat it as a discount code issue:
   * Ask for the code, the specific error message, and the items in their cart (a screenshot is very helpful).
   * Check Terms & Conditions: Did the reward have exclusions (e.g., sale items)? Cross-reference with cart contents.
   * Check Stacking: Are they trying to use it with another discount code? (Most rewards codes cannot be stacked).
   * Validity: Reward codes are often customer-specific/unique. You may not be able to test directly, but check the general reward rules.
   * Mock Cart (If Applicable): Try adding the same eligible items to a mock cart to see if a similar reward structure works (do not use their unique code).
   * If the code should work based on T&Cs and cart contents, but doesn't, gather customer details (account email, code, screenshot) and escalate.
Handling Store Credit
Store credit is typically issued directly by the brand.
1. How Customers Receive Store Credit
   * Often sent via email containing a unique code.
   * Can sometimes be accessed directly within the customer's account (less common).
   * Important: Advise customers to check their spam and promotional folders if they expect store credit via email but haven't seen it.
2. How Customers Redeem Store Credit
   * The store credit code is entered at checkout, often in the same field as discount codes or gift cards.
   * Usually functions as a payment method or gift card.
Troubleshooting Store Credit
1. Store Credit Code Not Working
   * Ask for a screenshot of the error they see at checkout and a screenshot of the email/source of the store credit to verify the code and any (rare) T&Cs. Remember: Store credits usually don't have cart minimums like discount codes.
   * Check Code Entry: Ensure they are typing it correctly.
   * Basic Troubleshooting: Suggest trying a different browser or device (send 'sww' template if applicable).
   * If it still doesn't work: Gather details (customer email, store credit code, error screenshot) and escalate.
Handling Gift Cards (Physical & E-Gift Cards)
Gift cards are usually purchased and function like currency.
1. How Customers Receive Gift Cards
   * Physical Cards: Mailed or purchased in person.
   * E-Gift Cards: Sent via email to the recipient address provided by the purchaser. Contains a unique code.
   * Important: For e-gift cards, advise recipients to check their spam and promotional folders. Verify the recipient email address was correct if the sender inquires.
2. How Customers Redeem Gift Cards
   * The gift card code is entered at checkout, typically in a dedicated gift card field or the discount code field.

Troubleshooting Gift Cards
1. Gift Card Code Not Working
   * Check Code Entry: Verify the code is being entered exactly as shown (case sensitivity might matter). Ask for a screenshot if possible.
   * Error Message: Ask for the specific error message. ("Invalid code" vs "Zero balance").
   * Balance Check: If the brand website has a balance check tool, guide the customer there. Otherwise, you may need to escalate for a balance check.
   * E-Gift Card Not Received: Advise checking spam/promo folders. Verify the recipient's email with the purchaser if possible. If still missing, escalate with purchaser details and recipient's email.
   * If the code seems valid but isn't accepted, gather details (customer email, gift card code, error screenshot) and escalate.
General Best Practices & Tips
   * Templates: Use available templates for rewards, credits, and related issues. Request templates if common scenarios are missing.
   * Website/FAQ: Always check the brand's website (Rewards page, FAQ) first if unsure about a specific policy or procedure, especially if a template isn't available.
   * Check Spam/Promo: Routinely remind customers to check these folders when expecting codes via email (store credit, e-gift cards, sometimes reward redemptions).
   * Escalation: Escalate issues when troubleshooting doesn't resolve the problem, when points/credit seem missing, or when a code should work but doesn't. Provide clear details (customer info, code, screenshots, steps taken).


Special Requests        
   * Customers may occasionally ask for exceptions (e.g., combining points from multiple accounts, applying expired points)
   * For these scenarios, always check if there are relevant templates
   * Unless the brand's FAQ or policies explicitly allow it, the standard procedure is to escalate the request or direct the customer to Customer Service (follow brand-specific workflow) to see if an exception can be made. Do not make promises.
   * Example (Combining Points): "Generally, points from separate accounts cannot be combined. However, I can certainly pass along your request to the relevant team to see if an exception is possible. Could I get the email addresses for both accounts?" (Adjust based on escalation procedure).
