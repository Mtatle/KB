More of a discussion in understanding definitions. Will put some words around clouds. Consider grouping brands.

     Homepage

The Homepage displays vital details, such as current promotions, featured products, or new services, while providing links to frequently visited sections. It reflects the company’s brand identity and priorities, allowing us to align our tone and style with the brand’s image
Understanding the layout and features of the homepage allows us to navigate the website confidently, improving customer interactions
A homepage typically follows this structure:
Search Bar
Header Section
Main Content
Footer
 Overview of the Homepage
Central hub of essential information
CTRL + F not read through everything - use short cuts, using blogs - do not overthink 

Concierge Sub Verticals
A sub vertical refers to a more specific niche or category within a broader industry

CTRL + F not read through everything - use short cuts, using blogs - do not overthink 

Search Bar
However, don’t over rely on the search bar!

Unless you are looking for a specific item, alternative methods like the URL trick or navigating through categories and sections will yield better results

The search bar is an incredibly useful tool for finding specific items on the website

What do we search for with the Search bar?

Links to "Best Sellers," "New Arrivals," "Deals", which are often sent to customers to check out

Access to product categories, making it easier to help customers narrow down their choices

Other essential pages depending on the brand
Header

The Top Banner above the header is where websites often highlight their:

Best Promotions
Free Shipping Thresholds 
Current Deals 

The Header is a website’s roadmap!

The Main Content area of a website is where the core information or offerings are presented. It’s the place where customers spend most of their time 
Main Content
What is the Main Content?

As agents, we typically spend less time in this section since most of the information is accessible elsewhere
Our focus shifts here primarily when:
A customer references specific content from this area
We need to check for new promotions or collections

Footer
Sign up for Email & SMS messaging 
Rewards Programs
Contact Information: Direct phone numbers, email addresses, and live chat options
Support Links: Access to FAQs, Order tracking
Company Info: About Us, Careers
Legal Pages: Terms and conditions, privacy policies, and disclaimers
Social Media
What’s Typically in the Footer?
The footer serves as a quick-access hub for important links and information that might not fit elsewhere

Live Support
While this tool is helpful for customers, we should never use it ourselves. Not for researching information, verifying promotions, or asking questions on behalf of the customer
These chat tools are designed for customers, not internal use by third-party teams like ours
The responses might be automated, brand-restricted, or handled by agents unfamiliar with our workflows
Why We Should Never Use it
Many brand websites have a Live Chat or Support Bot feature available for customers. These chat windows often appear on the bottom corner of the site and may include automated replies or live agents hired by the brand
What is Live Support?

     Product Page

A Product Page is a dedicated web page or section on an e-commerce website that provides detailed information about a specific product. Such as specifications, product contents, and sizing information
The Key Features of interest for Concierge are:
Primary Details:				
The Product Name
Description
Product Images 
Price
Additional Information:
Specifications
Availability
Customer reviews
 Overview of Product Pages
Why do we need the Product Page?
CTRL + F not read through everything - use short cuts, using blogs - do not overthink 

Keynote: Product Pages and Brand Websites in general, are designed to be helpful and readable. They are meant to encourage sales for customers

We send links to product pages, and general recommendations to encourage sales as well
 Product Page Functionality
What information can you gather from this product page?
What information could be useful?

Process of Creating Carts
Adding Items: Customers click “Add to Cart” to temporarily store products

Reviewing the Cart: Users can view selected items, adjust quantities, or remove products before finalizing the purchase. 

Proceeding to Checkout: When ready, the cart leads customers to the checkout page, where shipping, payment, and personal details are entered. At this point either reward points and or the promo code can often be added

Order Confirmation: Once payment is processed, the cart contents are cleared, and the order is finalized
How do Website Carts Work?
Whether promo codes are added during “reviewing the Cart” or during “Proceeding to Checkout”, or even both. Depends on the brand, usually for Shopify brands codes are added at checkout and rewards during reviewing the Cart.

Carts are more than just a tool for purchasing!
Coupon Code Testing: By adding items to the cart and entering coupon codes, we can confirm if the code applies to the items
Why do we use Carts?
Promotion Validation: Some promotions only appear in the cart. Testing, ensures the correct discount is applied
Troubleshooting Issues: If a customer reports a problem with pricing or promotions, we can replicate the process to diagnose potential issues
They’re a method to ease the purchase process 

For Shopify brands, we can create and send them directly through the interface, making the process easier for customers

Whenever possible, if the brand uses Shopify, we should send a cart link to simplify their experience!
Sending Shopify Carts
For non-Shopify brands we never send carts! The links will not provide the correct page
When do we send cart links?

     Company Policies

Company Policies ensure that every customer receives a standardized experience while protecting the company from potential legal and reputational risks

Importance of Policies 
Without well-understood policies, we may provide inconsistent answers, escalate issues unnecessarily, or unknowingly misrepresent the company’s position

Knowing company policies allows us to resolve issues quickly and confidently
Consistency in Customer Experience
Efficient Problem Resolution

Notes to remember:
They are usually hyperlinked in the footer section of the homepage 
We have templates for most common policies found in the UI

Websites often change content, pricing, product availability, and promotions based on the visitor’s location
If we send links without using a VPN, those links might direct customers to the wrong region’s site.
While most of our brands are based in the US, we also represent brands from other regions
Utilizing the VPN
Regional Differences in Web Pages


Always make sure your location is set to the US unless the customer or brand stated otherwise
May slow down website speed while turned on
Some websites will not load, unless it’s on
A few websites will only load if it’s off

Nord Layer
Nord Layer VPN, works by enveloping all of your online activities in a layer of encryption, while also hiding information about your virtual location
Things to remember!

Time for a break!


     Concierge UI Navigation

The User Interface (UI) is your main tool for providing excellent customer support 

It contains all the important information you need all in one place

The goal is to make this information easily accessible so you can quickly find answers while assisting customers

Most of your time will be spent working only within the UI
Importance of the UI
The UI is your first line of defense when it comes to research!


Browsing History is a helpful tool that shows the customer’s recent activity on a website or app. It lets you see which pages or products they viewed, when they viewed them, and even allows you to click on a link to revisit those pages
Browsing History
Represents a page or item the customer viewed but didn’t  take action on (e.g., just browsing or reading)
Represents a product the customer added to their shopping cart
What is Browsing History?

Browsing History Use Cases
Customer Intent
Upselling 
Abandoned Carts
We can use the history to recommend complementary products.
If a customer is asking about a product, you can check their browsing history to see which specific items they've viewed
If a customer didn’t complete a purchase, browsing history can show what was in their cart and help with troubleshooting

The Previous Purchases feature allows us to view a customer's purchased items, including the purchase dates, and provides links to the items for quick access. While this view is limited, it’s the only source of purchase details for non-Shopify brands, making it essential to use effectively
Keep in mind that for non-Shopify brands, the lack of Order Details will often require us to ask customers for additional information directly, and may potentially require escalating more issues than for Shopify brands
Previous Purchases
What is “Purchased”?

Order Details

The bottom section labeled Created can also show Canceled or Refunded, providing information about the status of the order

What are Order Details?
The Order Details feature provides a comprehensive overview of a customer’s order. It includes:
Order Number: A unique number for the purchase
Email: The email address associated with the order
Date of Purchase: The exact date the order was placed, useful for tracking timelines and resolving time-sensitive issues
The Email and Order Number can be be easily copied using the copy button
Some order confirmation pages may have blurred-out details. If a customer is searching for this information, direct them to log in



Safeguarding personal information is not just a legal obligation but also a cornerstone of building trust with customers and verifying their identity
Personal information includes any data that can uniquely identify an individual such as:
Phone numbers
Email addresses
Credit card details
Shipping or Billing addresses
Sharing Personal Information

Since order numbers and tracking numbers/links are not tied directly to an individual’s identity but rather to a specific purchase, they can be confirmed or shared without explicit consent

Why Is Consent Critical?

We must first request customers to provide necessary details themselves before we share personal information
Getting Customer Consent
Our standard practice is to ask the customer to provide their email address for verification
However, if the customer cannot provide this information, or if the email they provide does not match the one displayed in our system, we proceed with a secondary verification process
In such cases, we request the customer’s:
Full Name
Shipping Address
What if we need to share information we have available in the UI?

Define

1.

To define the Research Objective:

We need to carefully read the conversation to fully understand the customer’s message

We should figure out what they are looking for, whether: 

They have a specific request
There is something we can offer to help them
Defining the Research Objective
Research Objective
1
The product I ordered is the wrong color :(
Thank you for reaching out! How may I help you today?

Common Pitfalls
What if the customer’s message is not understandable or is missing crucial info?
We can ask the customer to clarify
What if the customer’s message revolves around a topic we are not knowledgeable in and don’t understand?
We can take the time to Google and learn more
What if the customer has multiple concerns or questions?
We make sure to answer them all
While asking the customer to clarify it’s very important to provide a follow up question to try to understand them better. Try to piece together the situation from the information you have.

Scan

2.

When you scan, the goal is to quickly find everything related to the objective you’ve defined in the prior step

Keywords
A keyword is a word used as a reference point for finding other words or information

We use keywords by typing out words related to the our research objective that come to mind. These words can include specific problem types, product names, or common troubleshooting terms that help pinpoint the core of the issue

             Use several words or sentences
Use the plural form of words, adjectives, or the verbal form
Use uncommon vocabulary or vocabulary that isn’t appropriate to the brand


 
Use a single word or keep them short
Type the root of the word without any additional suffixes
Typing all possible synonyms you can think off for the topic

Keyword Examples

When it comes to keywords, flexibility is key. While there are general rules and best practices for using keywords effectively, it’s always best to experiment!

Ctrl + F (or Command + F on Mac) is a keyboard shortcut that allows you to quickly search for specific words or phrases on a web page or document. It opens a small search bar where you can type what you’re looking for, and it highlights all instances of that word or phrase on the page
Using Ctrl + F
2
It pinpoints exactly where your keyword appears and you can jump straight to the relevant part of the page
Pro Tip!  Use the arrows in the search bar to move quickly
What is Ctrl + f?



The "URL trick" is a quick and powerful way to use Google to search for specific information on a website. Instead of manually browsing the site, you simply ask Google to find the relevant pages for you by combining the website link with your keyword in the search bar


Using the URL Trick
2
Basic Format: https://www.website.com [keyword]
What is the URL Trick?

Unlike Ctrl + F, we can use long and loose keywords, as Google will suggest closest matches and related content
For exact matches, put your keyword in quotes:
www.example.com "return policy"
URL Trick Heads-up
2
The end of the link needs to be “.com”. Do not include anything after “.com”. If you do, Google will treat the additional text as part of the link, and you may get a 404 error
We can combine keywords for a narrower search:
 www.example.com shipping delays refund

 Narrowing Down
 Avoiding errors
Choosing Keywords

URL Trick
URL Trick vs Ctrl + F

Searches for specific content across a website
Can find related and similar matches
Ideal for websites with lots of content where we don’t know which page has the information we’re looking for
Used to search for webpages

2

Searches for specific text on the current page
Finds exact matches of text entered
Ideal for scanning a single web page very quickly to only read parts that are of interest
Used to search a webpage
Ctrl + F
URLs work best for finding specific or complex content, e.g. particular blog. On the other hand, Ctrl + F is great for quickly scanning policies once you’re on the relevant page of the website

Practice choosing keywords and explore the possibilities
Use tools like the URL trick to narrow results and Ctrl + F to quickly locate specific terms on a page 
Mastering these skills will save you valuable time and improve your efficiency drastically

Special Materials:
Notes: Always read the notes! They are a valuable source of information, but they contain brand rules and preferences as well which should not be overlooked
Google/Chat GPT:  These can be used for general questions, but never for anything brand-specific. For brand-related queries, always rely on official sources

Social Media 

1. For inquiries about a product, the product page is usually the best and most immediate resource
2. When customers ask about a promotion, the conditions are often included in the original journey message sent to them. In these cases we would start by backreading and if the conditions aren’t there, the promo notes should be your next stop 
Knowing where to Scan

To provide excellent support, we must Identify where the information is most likely to be found
Here’s how we approach two common scenarios:

3.

Accuracy and Relevance
3
If all the information shared is correct,      what did the agent miss out on?
Even after finding information directly from the website, it's important to double-check to ensure you're providing accurate and relevant information

Read for your own understanding, not just to construct a response
Only share the details which the customer is interested in
Always ensure that your response directly answers the customer’s question
Put yourself in the customer’s shoes and try your best to help
Best Practices

It’s important to:

Common Pitfalls 
3
Sending messages without understanding what we have written
Copy pasting long paragraphs of text 
This is a texting platform, not email. Our messages should be short and clear 
Providing counterproductive information that won’t address their concern
We should avoid:

Non-Decisive Language
3
There are times when we may not have immediate answers or complete information. During such moments, we use non-decisive language like “should,” “could,” or “might”
Making definitive statements without certainty can lead to misunderstandings or false promises, so:
Instead of saying: “This will fix the issue,”
Say: “This step should resolve the issue, but if not, I’m here to assist further.”
Why use Non-Decisive Language?

We’re at the Final Stretch!

1. Make sure your message is easy to understand and grammatically correct
2. Show the customer that you understand their concern, assure them you’re there to help, and thank them when possible
3. Be friendly, encourage conversation, and follow the preferred tone for the brand
4. Double-check any links you provided and information you’ve shared to make sure they are correct
5. Customers avoid reading long blocks of text keep it concise or segmented into smaller parts
6. Always leave the conversation open for discussion
