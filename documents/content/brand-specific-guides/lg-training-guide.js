About the brand

LG is a multibillion-dollar corporation stemming from South Korea. They mainly focus on providing consumers with TVs, telecommunication solutions (smartphones are phasing out), washing machines & dryers, refrigerators, and other household appliances, to name a few. Having been around since 1958 and starting in plastics, they have since then expanded into several different industries. At the forefront, they seek to satisfy consumers’ needs through innovation, while also generally being more cost-efficient than their competitors.


As LG is one of our bigger clients, it is imperative that we follow the correct workflow guided by company information in order to provide the best customer experience and maintain client satisfaction. As long as we know how to use the tools and resources available, we’ll be able to attain all the necessary information to help resolve any issues for customers. 

Guidelines

This guide is going to walk you through the most frequently encountered LG processes and how to approach them like a pro. You’ll learn about how to handle:

Research and navigate the LG website
Product comparison/compatibility questions
Delivery service questions


NOTE: If it's a new conversation and we didn't introduce ourselves in the automated message, start your message with: "This is Jordan at LG."


Navigating LG’s Website


Finding product specifications and features:

One of the more common scenarios we’ll run into is when customers ask what specs and features products have. Here is the step-by-step on how to handle these conversations.

Identify the situation
Did the customer mention what exact product(s) they’re referring to?
If not, first check their Browsing History/Purchases and the last automated message sent by our client, and check the link. If still not clear, and there’s no automated message available, and/or there’s a large list under Browsing History, ask the customer. 
If yes, move on to #2





How to navigate to the product(s) page
Use the UI’s Browsing History/Purchases to go directly to the product(s) page.
Alternatively, use LG’s search tool (click the magnifying glass icon on the top), type in the model number or keywords befitting the product(s) in question.
Verifying the Correct Product Page
Keep a watch for major identifiers in the name; for example
Inches (55”, 65”, 77”, etc.)
Model class (A2, B2, C2, etc.)
OLED77B2PUA vs OLED77B2AUA - difference in the model # (P vs A)
Specific tech features - OLED, 4K, QNED, NanoCell, etc.




Navigating Product Pages Effectively

Here you’ll find most of what you need at a glance; by using Ctrl + F for searching keywords on the product page, it will help you avoid having to scan everything.

If the customer is asking for more specifics, you can also select these tabs at the top of the page:

When you click on a tab, it takes you to the specific section within the page. Each tab has a wealth of information we can use for our responses. Let’s go over each of them:

Overview: Filled with tasteful descriptions of the key features, we can use words or phrases here to excite or visually describe the product to our customers.


Related Products: These are also under the overview to find compatible add-ons, such as an appropriate soundbar for a TV to create a combo. There is also a Related Accessories section below this one.



Specs: Contains almost ALL we need in terms of specific info. Go here to find product dimensions, technologies included, power usage, accessories, compatibility, and more. You can filter for the different options as shown below:

Note: A lot of technical terms are used here. If you’re not familiar, please do a quick Google search to get the definition.

Reviews: Use reviews to get an idea of what buyers think + circumstantial information (e.g., customer asked if a specific speaker’s bass can be heard through thick walls, and a reviewer said it can from their experience).






The Q&A section is also somewhere you can find relevant info, and the answers at the top are usually provided by LG’s customer service and are considered credible. 


Similar Products: This offers you similar products to the one you are looking at. You can share them as alternative or additional recommendations for the customer.


Support: Use this to direct customers to the product’s warranty info, manuals, registration, tutorials, troubleshooting, and more!
“Find a retailer”: This feature on the product page leads us to where else we can find the product online or in-store nearby. Use it to provide alternative online retailers for our customers + local retailers (if a ZIP code was provided).












































Handling Product Availability Inquiries

When a customer asks about product availability, it's important to note that availability often varies based on the customer’s location. To provide an accurate and helpful response, follow these steps:

Request the Customer's Zip Code: This allows you to check availability and estimated delivery time specific to their area.
Verify Availability on the Product Page: Use the provided zip code to check the product’s availability and estimated delivery date directly on the product page.
Share the Product Link: Always include a direct link to the product in your response, so the customer can view it for themselves.

Keep in mind that customers may see different information when opening a product link, as zip codes are stored in browser cache. They won’t necessarily see the same availability or delivery details you do.

Suggested Message Template:

"I'd be happy to check if this item is available in your area. Could you please provide your zip code? You can also view the product here: [product link]"

Using LG’s filters

While LG’s filter options leave much to be desired, they do help narrow things down on a basic level. This is especially useful if a customer asks which OLED TVs come with ThinQ AI technology or are Universal Magic Remote compatible. Let’s have a look at what we’re talking about.

To start, LG’s filters are found on the left-hand side of the page once you select a major category, such as Refrigerators. 


The page will appear with all 4 main refrigerator door types available on the page. You will need to select one, either on the top or on the left-hand side, to see only those options.


















Here,  you’ll find various features to select from that will help narrow down options. 
Selecting 1 feature may gray out others. In the example above, when we select “French door”, only two widths become available.

Toggle Filter

If you already know the customer’s zipcode, you can update it under “Shipping to”, and then you can filter by items “On-Sale” or “In-Stock” to ship to their location by toggling (moving the circle to the right).











We can also find Discontinued Products at the bottom of the filter bar, which may help give us context when a customer asks about a phased-out product.










Finally, if you’d like to reset your filters, click on “Clear Filters” to start from scratch.



Navigating LG’s Support/Help Library

LG’s Support and Help Library is resource-rich and helps you find most things the customer will ask you about. Here is how to find and use them to our advantage.

Support
On the homepage, click on Support to see the different support options:


Once here, you can select the specific issue you need support with, or scroll a bit lower to search by model number. 



For this example, let's search for the model #: LRFOC2606S, and we’ll be directed to the product's support page.

























Once here, we can find a wealth of information such as warranty, manuals & software, as well as helpful articles that all correspond to the product in question.

How-tos are more common scenarios we face, so do use the articles available. We also have the option of searching for Video Tutorials on the LG YouTube channel under the Troubleshooting support page.


Leveraging external links/websites affiliated with LG

Sometimes we’ll come across scenarios where a product/promo/warranty may not be available on LG’s main website. If it isn’t there, it may be on websites affiliated with our client. Here are some examples: 

Replacement parts
https://lgparts.com/ 
https://encompass.com/ - direct either one for when parts are OOS on LG’s website or for DIYers
Promos/Rebates/Specials
https://appliances.lg-promos.com/en-US/all-promotions - direct cx to specific specials
Extended warranty
https://www.lgpremiumcare.com/quote - direct cx here for information on LG’s extended warranties

Product comparison and compatibility

How to compare products
You need to toggle the compare button on the product page. You can add up to 4 items to compare.



Do this to all products necessary. 

How to find differences/similarities and features 

Once you add the products for comparison, click on the compare button. You will be redirected to a comparison page. 
On this page, the specifications of each product will be listed.

Note: You CANNOT share the comparison page link (the customer will see a blank page). 



Sharing comparison Info with the customer

Find which specification/feature the customer is looking for. If you’re having trouble locating where it is on the page, CTRL+F is your friend. 
‘Yes’ indicates that the product has that feature while dashes indicate the opposite. 
If the comparison can be shared simply through chats, pass the info along to the customer.
For accuracy, using/sending screenshots is the recommended approach when sharing comparison information. 
Take a screenshot of the necessary details using Lightshot. If not  applicable, there are free websites that offer the same service like https://snipboard.io/ 
Save the sc to your computer. Upload the screenshot and get the link. 
Send the link to the customer.


Note: When using the Add to Compare template, do NOT rely on it completely. Use it ONLY if the main differences are extensive and cannot be captured in a text or one screenshot. That way, the customer can check for themselves. 













Examples of non-compliance can look like:

When a customer indicates that they can’t see a specific difference, ask them which feature they’re looking for so we can narrow down the things to compare. We can also enumerate the biggest differences when the customer is asking generally. 


The customer specified which feature they’re interested in knowing more about. The agent could’ve explained how they differ. 





Examples of compliance can look like: 





















How to check for compatibility 

In instances where the customer is looking for compatible accessories or products. First, get the model # of the customer’s appliance/device/item as well as the part of the product they’re inquiring about. 

Here are the main ways to see compatible products on the website: 

Most accessories have the option to check for compatible products on the product page using the model #. 

You can find the compatible products under the key features on the product page: 



















Examples of non-compliance can look like:

How to Find Installation and Troubleshooting Resources

LG has a comprehensive knowledge base that can be accessed in its Help Library. 
Identify which item/appliance the customer needs help with. 
The Help Library has two filtering or search options we can utilize, which are Search by Product or Keyword:







LG also has a specialized page for TV set-up for step-by-step guides by device and Cable Connector.

Note: Feel free to use whichever would help resolve the customer’s issue faster. 

Manuals and other support options are available on every product page. 
You will find the support tab as described in the sections above. 
Check the Manuals and Downloads tabs to see if there’s a resource that could help the customer. (Video Support is preferred but not required. This is just to give the customers more reference when troubleshooting themselves) 
Use the URL trick to locate keywords for faster navigation and solution identification. 
If you need to download the product’s manual to check, do so in consideration of handle time. Google is your friend, ask it for help whenever needed and applicable. 
For basic troubleshooting for common problems, we can always rely on Google. 
Including but not limited to the following: 
Setting up wires
Activating wi-fi connection in smart TVs 
Roku, Apple TV, Amazon TV, AT&T TV, Netflix, Amazon Prime set up, etc.
