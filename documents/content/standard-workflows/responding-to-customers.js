Responding To Customers

Backreading
Gives full context and understanding about an issue – Reviewing previous messages helps us see what the customer has already shared, info from automated journeys, what steps have been taken, and any past resolutions. This allows us to know what our next steps should be. 
Avoids repetition and redundant questions – Backreading ensures we don’t ask for the same information the customer has already provided or repeat details a previous agent has already shared. This makes the conversation feel more seamless and professional.
Ensures continuity – Customers should feel like they’re speaking to one person, not restarting the conversation with each agent. Keeping track of previous interactions helps maintain a smooth and consistent experience.
Why is it important?
Backreading: Why It’s Important
Thorough backreading ensures a full understanding of the issue before responding. This includes:
Context and Understanding: Reviewing previous messages helps us see what the customer has already shared, any automated responses they received, previous troubleshooting steps, and past resolutions. This helps us determine our next steps.
Preventing Redundant Questions: Avoids asking for details the customer has already provided, which can lead to frustration. And we make sure that we don’t repeat what others have already shared. 
Ensuring Continuity: Customers should feel like we are picking up where they left off rather than starting from scratch. And we need to ensure that it feels like they’re talking to one person so we also need to be aware of what other agents have communicated. 


Scan for key details – Quickly review the conversation history to identify important information such as order numbers, specific product inquiries, past troubleshooting steps, or promotions. For simple cases, a quick scan works, but for complex issues with multiple messages and long threads, a thorough backread is necessary to avoid missing anything important.
Check for unresolved issues or misguidance – Look for any concerns that haven’t been fully addressed or instances where the customer may have received conflicting or incorrect information. If necessary, clarify and correct any misguidance.
Look for tone cues – Pay attention to how the customer is expressing themselves. Are they frustrated, excited, or just asking a neutral question? Matching their tone appropriately (with empathy, enthusiasm, or professionalism) helps make the conversation feel more natural and personalized.
How to effectively backread
Backreading
How to Effectively Backread:
Scan for Key Details
We need to be able to skim and scan through threads to look for key information. So this means we should lookout  for order numbers, product inquiries, past troubleshooting steps, or promotions. While scanning is useful for straightforward questions, more complex back-and-forth issues require a thorough review to ensure no crucial details are missed. If the conversation involves multiple touchpoints, conflicting information, or escalations, take the time to fully backread before responding.

Check for Unresolved Issues or Misguidance
Ensure no questions were left unanswered.
Look for any incorrect or conflicting information the customer may have received and provide corrections if needed.
Look for Tone Cues
Determine if the customer is frustrated, neutral, or enthusiastic.
Match their tone appropriately - using empathy, enthusiasm, or professionalism where needed.
Example:
Instead of asking, "Can you confirm your order number?" when they’ve already provided it, acknowledge their previous message and move forward: "I see you reached out earlier about [issue]. Let me check on this for you!"

Composing A Response


Searching templates is an essential step in quickly finding accurate info on any topic we encounter. 

By using the search bar and relevant keywords, we can efficiently locate the relevant templates that best address the customer's question.

We need to tailor templates if necessary to only leave relevant parts for the customer. 
Templates
Using Templates Effectively
Templates help maintain speed and accuracy, but they must be used correctly:
Search Using Keywords: Use relevant keywords to quickly find the best-suited templates.
Example: Searching “refund”, “return” “policy” if we’re looking for information about the return policy.
Tailor Templates for Personalization:
Remove irrelevant details.
Acknowledge their unique concern.
Never copy-paste templates without adjusting them to be completely relevant to the customer’s unique situation if necessary.

Website:
If information isn’t available in the UI, check the website’s FAQs, help libraries, product pages, or blogs for answers. Make sure to cover all your bases and exhaust resources. 



If the company’s website is difficult to navigate, we can use Google to find relevant info. Simply paste the brand’s website URL followed by keywords related to what we’re searching for. The first few results will usually lead us to the info we need.

Hey, thanks for reaching out! I totally get how tricky sizing can be, especially when trying a new brand. You’re right, our running shoes run a bit small. Based on your usual size, I would recommend going up half a size for a more comfortable fit. If you’d like, you can also check out our size guide for more detailed measurements here: *link*. Let me know if you have more questions, happy to help!
Hi, I’m thinking about ordering a pair of running shoes, but I’m not sure about the size. I normally wear a 9 in most brands, but I’ve heard your shoes run small. Could you help me figure out if I should size up?
