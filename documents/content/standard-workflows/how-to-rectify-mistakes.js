Rectifying Mistakes
When we make a mistake, we’re generally expected to
Acknowledge the Mistake
Apologize Sincerely
Correct the Information
However, at the same time, we should use our soft skills to guide the conversation forward in a natural and thoughtful way—picking up from where the customer left off. The transition should feel seamless, as if the same person is continuing the discussion.
Avoid vague language or shifting blame
Show empathy for any confusion caused
Provide updated, accurate details


These occur when a conversation is escalated by mistake, often when escalation wasn’t necessary
Common Scenarios
Escalation Errors
Thanks for your patience! I just heard back from the team, and here's what they shared...
Apologies for the back and forth! I just double-checked and…
Prevent escalation when possible. If already escalated, continue the conversation as if we've received an update from the team and de-escalate the conversation

Sometimes we send to CS when we could have resolved the issue ourselves
Sending to CS
In these cases, we should take ownership and offer the solution directly


If we share something inaccurate, it's important to correct it promptly and transparently
Common Scenarios
Incorrect Information
I'm so sorry for any confusion, my honest mistake! After double-checking…
Also, regarding your other question, here’s what I found out...
In these cases, own the mistake, correct the info, and apologize for any confusion

Sometimes we may miss part of the customer's question
Partial Replies
When this happens, follow up clearly and naturally, picking up right where the customer left off

If we're expected to close the conversation, but notice an unresolved mistake made by a previous agent
Common Scenarios
Close Scenarios
Sorry for any confusion! Before we wrap up, I just want to clarify…
In such cases, we shouldn’t immediately close, instead we should respond with empathy and continue to rectify the issue

Rectifying Mistakes
Responsibility

Regardless of how long a conversation has been going on, we are always responsible for providing accurate information. If at any point an incorrect resolution was given, it’s important that we follow up with the customer
Responsibility
Never repeat previous agents' messages without proper examination. Before responding whether you're about to close the conversation or escalate it, take the time to backread and ensure you're taking the correct next step based on the full context
If you can’t provide a solution right away, but the issue might be solvable through basic troubleshooting, ask thoughtful follow-up questions and guide the customer through next steps
If you ever spot a mistake rectify it!
