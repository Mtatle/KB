What’s not credible 

What are Credible Sources
If the brand didn’t say it, or we can’t trace it back to them, we don’t pass it along as fact.
A credible source is one that is brand-owned, brand-managed, or brand-confirmed. That means it comes directly from the company the customer is speaking to — not from your own assumptions, Google guesses, or crowdsourced platforms.
The most credible sources are always brand-owned or brand-managed. These include:
What Makes a Source “Credible”?
Official Brand Website
Verified Social Media Pages

Product Page Q&A or Reviews


Help Center / FAQ Pages


Newsletters & Emails


Links from the brand or in the UI 


What are Credible Sources
The official website of the brand is the gold standard. Anything hosted at [brand].com or shop.[brand].com is published and maintained by the company. Product details, sizing, FAQs, return policies, shipping estimates — if it’s here, you can trust it.
Official Brand Website
That said, always make sure the site is legitimate, not a lookalike, reseller, or third-party retailer. The domain should match the brand’s name exactly.

What are Credible Sources
If the brand has verified social media accounts, those are also considered first-party sources. Look for blue checkmarks, the word “Official,” or clear brand identity markers.
Verified Social Media Pages
Only trust posts published by the brand itself, not customer comments or reposts from other users. If the post was deleted, do not cite it.

What are Credible Sources
On many product pages, there’s a section where customers can ask questions and brands can respond. This is often found under "Q&A" or "Ask a Question."
Product Page Q&A or Reviews
If the brand itself responds to a question, and it’s clearly marked as "Answered by the seller" or "Brand Representative", that counts as credible. But if the answer is written by another customer or marked “Community answer,” do not treat it as verified
Always check for things like the brand’s badge, “Official seller” label, or the brand’s official name under a review

What are Credible Sources
Most brands maintain a central help centre, FAQ, or support page. These often include up-to-date information on:
Help Center / FAQ Pages
These are credible, as long as they’re published on the brand’s own website. Do not pull from help articles hosted on third-party sites.
Shipping, returns, & warranty
Subscription terms
Product instructions
Account troubleshooting

What are Credible Sources
Many brands send marketing emails or newsletters to announce launches, sales, or new policies. These are considered credible as long as they come from the brand’s official email domain (e.g. info@brand.com).
Newsletters & Emails
One helpful tool is Milled. It’s a public archive that saves brand newsletters exactly as they were sent. It’s useful when you need to retrieve or confirm a specific campaign from the brand.

What are Credible Sources
If a link appears inside the customer’s profile, checkout pages or tracking links, it is considered a credible source.
Links from the brand or in the UI 
These pages are usually generated by the brand or a trusted vendor (e.g. Shopify). That said, always verify that the URL leads back to the brand’s own environment and hasn’t been spoofed. These links are great for confirming order status or tracking updates amongst other things.

What are Credible Sources
Another credible source is one that is brand-owned, brand-managed, brand-confirmed, or directly linked by the brand as an affiliate or partner.
Links from the brand or in the UI 
Some brands may link to outside pages, such as sister brands, partner services, or campaign-specific microsites. If it’s linked from the brand’s official site or within the UI, it’s considered safe to use.

Before answering a customer question, ask yourself:
Quick Checklist for Finding Verified Info
If the answer is no to all of these, pause and verify first, or escalate if you're unsure.
What are Credible Sources
Did this come from the brand’s official website or help center?
Is this a brand’s verified social media post or story?
Is this visible directly on the product page or Q&A section with a brand response?
Have I seen this in an official brand update or an FAQ page?

 When in doubt, escalate and don’t guess!
How to Use Tools Responsibly
You can use Google to help you locate a brand’s help page faster. But the search result itself is not the answer.
Never cite:
Google Is a Shortcut, Not a Source
Blog posts or opinion pieces
Snippets from Reddit or Quora
Third-party resellers
Review sites or aggregator listings
Note: It’s also okay to use Google for your own understanding. For example, if a customer mentions a holiday, ingredient, or part you’re unfamiliar with. Just don’t treat what you find as sourceable information unless it comes from the brand.

But it should never generate the facts for you. AI can be confidently wrong, and if you rely on it for specs, policy details, or product availability, you risk giving incorrect info. Always pull details from the brand, then let AI help you express it, not invent it.
How to Use Tools Responsibly
AI tools like ChatGPT can be useful for formatting your thoughts, paraphrasing a complex reply, or summarising large chunks of data from a verified source.
AI Can Help You Draft, Not Decide

What’s not credible 

If you can’t trace it back to the brand itself, it’s not credible.
What’s not Credible
Here’s what we don’t use, even if it looks polished or sounds logical:
Examples of Non-Credible Sources
Reddit threads or YouTube videos
Influencer pages or personal blogs
Third-party store listings (Walmart, Amazon, etc.)
Articles from press or “news” sites quoting rumours
Customer guesses in the Q&A or review section
Other customers’ comments on Instagram or TikTok

Unless the brand has published a statement confirming that, don’t say it. Our job is to pass along accurate, official info, not to fill in the gaps with assumptions, even if they seem obvious.
What’s not Credible
Another example of things that aren’t credible are polished answers that sound convincing but don’t come from any source. Just because something sounds logical doesn’t mean we should say it. Example:
Convincing but Not Confirmed

That means we never use Honey or similar tools (like Capital One Shopping, RetailMeNot, etc.) to look up or test codes. These platforms often surface expired, region-locked, or one-time-use promotions that the brand hasn’t publicly confirmed. They are not credible sources of information, and we should never reference them in customer communication.
What’s not Credible
Honey is a browser extension that automatically applies promo codes at checkout. While it can be convenient for customers, the codes it finds are not provided or approved by the brand.
Third-Party Coupon Extensions

We should not share codes received through personal subscriptions, since those messages are not connected to the customer’s account and may be account-specific, single-use, or expired.
The best path is always to direct the customer to sign up for the brand’s newsletter themselves or to check the brand’s website and official channels for available promotions. If there’s a banner, pop-up, or offer visible in the customer experience, that counts as a credible and shareable promotion.
What’s not Credible
Sometimes customers ask if there’s a welcome code or promotional discount available. While it might be tempting to look for one in a brand email you’ve received personally, we need to be careful about how we source this type of info.
Email Codes Must Come From the Brand
