In this video, we’re going to talk about escalations - what they are, when it’s safe to escalate, and how to do it properly. We’ll also cover the different types of escalations and what information is needed in each case.
Now, most of the time, the tools we have in the app and the information available on the brand’s website are enough to help us assist customers confidently. But every now and then, we hit a wall - maybe we’re missing key information, or the issue needs someone from the brand’s own support team to step in. That’s exactly where escalations come into play.
Let’s start by understanding what the escalation process actually looks like.

Escalating is a process that allow us to forward customer issues to the brand’s customer support team when we are unable to resolve them ourselves. This ensures customers receive the best possible assistance directly from the brand.

  Always follow brand guidelines to determine the right course of action when it comes to escalating
Escalating is a process that allows us to forward customer issues to the brand’s customer support team when we’re unable to resolve them ourselves. This ensures customers receive the best possible assistance - especially when we don’t have the tools or permissions to fully help. It allows us to maintain a seamless 1:1 interaction with the customer—since from their perspective, we are the brand. Escalating is designed to be a streamlined way for us to get the information we don’t have, without interrupting the flow of the conversation.
Here are the core concepts to remember:
Escalations are copies of customer interactions sent via email to the brand’s customer support team.
Escalations are mainly used when we lack access or information needed to assist the customer.
Always follow brand guidelines to determine the appropriate next step - some brands want us to escalate right away, others may want us to direct customers elsewhere, or troubleshoot first.
Now that you understand what escalations are and why they matter, let’s look at the types of escalations you’ll come across.

Types of Escalations
These involve inquiries escalated for customers who have not yet placed an order. These can include product availability, pricing discrepancies, promotions, or any other questions before making a purchase.
           No customer information is needed before escalating! 
The only exceptions to this are if:
      	The brand’s notes/templates specifically state otherwise
      	The issue involves an account-related concern, in which case we ask for the customer’s email

Pre-purchase
1

 Let’s start with the first type: Pre-Purchase Escalations
These are for situations we escalate when a customer reaches out with a question before placing an order. This might be about product availability, pricing discrepancies, current promotions, or really any inquiry that comes up before the customer checks out. So if we’re not able to get an answer for them, we escalate. 
Now, here’s the key thing to remember: We do not need to collect customer information before escalating a pre-purchase inquiry.
That said, there are a couple of exceptions to keep in mind:
If the brand’s notes specifically say to collect something, follow that guidance.
And if the customer’s question is related to their account, we’ll need to ask for their email address.
Other than that, pre-purchase escalations are pretty straightforward.







         If order details are visible in the UI:
We confirm the order number with the customer
We ask for the email address (even if visible) to maintain data privacy.


These involve escalated issues related to an order that has already been placed, such as shipping delays, missing items, refunds, or defective products.
        Before escalating, always collect the order number, and email address or any other details specified in the notes/templates.
If the customer cannot provide both the order number and the email address (or if the email address on the order is showing a typo), you can instead ask them to confirm :
Their full name on the order and the shipping address.



       
Post-purchase





         If order details are not visible in the UI:
We need to ask for both the order number and email from the customer.


Types of Escalations
Now let’s talk about the next type: Post-Purchase Escalations.
These come into play when a customer has already placed an order, and something’s gone wrong - or they need help with something specific regarding their order. This could include things like shipping delays, missing items, refund requests, or even defective products.
Because these issues are tied to an existing order, it’s really important that we gather the right information before escalating.
We always need to collect the order number and the customer’s email address, along with any extra details mentioned in the brand’s notes. That’s because the brand’s customer support team needs those details to actually track down the order and help the customer effectively.
Now, depending on the brand, here’s what we do:
If the order details are visible in the UI:
We confirm the order number with the customer just to be sure.
We still ask for their email—even if we can see it—because it helps protect the customer’s privacy and ensures data security. We should never share the email first to the customer.
If the order details are not visible in the UI:
We’ll need to ask the customer directly for both the order number and their email address.
Of course, if the customer has already provided us with the order details in their messages, there’s no need to ask or confirm - we can move towards escalating right away.
Gathering all of that upfront helps the brand resolve the issue faster—and makes the escalation process way smoother for everyone.

When To Escalate


We only escalate when all other options have been exhausted. This means thoroughly checking the UI and all other relevant brand resources. If, after researching, we’re still unable to provide a resolution, then and only then do we escalate.


After Troubleshooting
Notes
Templates
Other UI features
Brand website and socials
Google & other search tools
Notes may include guidance on how to handle specific topics and indicate whether an escalation is necessary.
Templates provide key information about the brand and its products that we can share when relevant.
This involves reviewing the conversation thread, checking the promo section and coupon inspector for the latest promo info, and looking at the customer profile to view their order history.
If we can't find the information we need in the UI, we move on to the website - this includes FAQs, Help Centers, and product pages. We then check official social media pages for any updates or additional details.
If the website is difficult to navigate, we can use Google to locate specific pages - but we should only rely on credible sources for information.
Alright, so when do we actually escalate something?
There are two main situations where it makes sense to escalate:
1. After Troubleshooting: Escalation should only happen after we’ve exhausted every other option. That means checking everything available to us—like the UI (so that’s the company and customer profile, and backreading the thread), brand FAQs, web pages, and any relevant credible resources. If we’ve done our research and we still can’t help the customer, then that’s our signal to escalate.
2. Following Company Guidelines:
If something is an escalation preference topic, we still need to see if we can find info on our end to help the customer with the resolution, otherwise if nothing comes up the brand prefers for us to escalate.  And In some cases, the brand’s notes will say to escalate an issue immediately—no need for extra digging or troubleshooting. In those cases, we just go ahead and escalate straight away.
Keep in Mind: If the brand’s notes say to send the customer cs - that means we don’t escalate! Instead, we use the appropriate CS template to direct the customer to the brand’s support team - meaning they can directly email or call
So just remember: we either troubleshoot first or follow the brand’s lead - but we never escalate by default. It’s always based on need and guidance.


When To Escalate
If the topic is an escalation preference (after troubleshooting)
If the brand’s notes and guidelines state to escalate “immediately”, we do so without troubleshooting.
2.  Following Company Guidelines
If the brand’s notes instruct us to send the customer to cs (customer support) that means we should send the customer support template or appropriate template that directs them to send an email or phone directly. We should not escalate!

Keep In Mind!

How To Escalate
1.   Gather all the required information

Depending on whether it’s a pre-purchase or post purchase issue
2.   Initiate the escalation
Click the Escalate button or use the shortcut Shift + E
A pop-up will appear where we enter a summary of the issue (do not copy and paste the customer’s message - paraphrase and summarize instead).
For post-purchase issues, include order details (order number and email).
Click the yellow “Escalate” button

Now that we understand when to escalate, let’s go over how we actually do it:
1. Gather All Required Information First things first, make sure you have all the relevant details based on whether it’s a pre-purchase or post-purchase issue. For pre-purchase, this could just be the customer’s inquiry or if it’s an account issue we’d need their email. For post-purchase, we’ll need things like the order number, email, and any specifics the brand has noted. 
2. Initiate the Escalation Once you’ve gathered the necessary info, click the Escalate button on the top right corner of the UI or use the shortcut Shift + E. A pop-up will appear where you’ll paraphrase and summarize the issue—don’t just copy and paste the customer’s message. For post-purchase issues, don’t forget to include the order number and email or just the email for account issues. Then, click the yellow “Escalate” button to submit it.


3.   Inform the customer
Send a message confirming that we’ve forwarded their issue to our team and will get back to them soon
Send the message only after escalating, or the system may unassign you from the conversation

4.   Confirmation of escalation
A green banner at the top of the conversation will show once an escalation has been completed. It will display the agent’s name and the summary.

5.   Customer Follow-Ups
If a customer asks for an update after two business days and has not received a response, we refer them to cs.
How To Escalate
3. Inform the Customer Once the escalation is complete, let the customer know you’ve sent their issue to the team. Send a message confirming that their issue has been forwarded, and that you’ll follow up with them soon. Remember, send this message only after escalating, or you might lose the conversation.
4. Confirmation of Escalation Once the escalation is submitted, you’ll see a green banner at the top of the conversation. This banner confirms the escalation and will show the agent’s name and the issue summary. So, if you see it, you’ll know the escalation is in place.
5. Customer Follow-Ups If a customer asks for an update after two business days and hasn’t received a response, simply refer them to customer support, so that means sending the cs template.  We shouldn’t de-escalate at this point—just guide them to the right team for a follow-up.
Now let’s see how all this plays out live on the UI [LIVE DEMO]

Escalation Responses
De-escalating

Escalation Responses
Responses from brands are handled by the Escalation/Follow-Up Team, so we do not need to reply to the customer ourselves.
When an escalation is resolved, we’ll see a message like:
“Thanks for your patience, I just heard back from the team –” followed by the brand’s info.
These responses appear as normal messages from a Concierge agent but will address the escalated issue.




Once resolved, the conversation is de-escalated, and the green banner will disappear.

Let’s move on to Escalation Responses. 
Once an escalation is sent, it’s the responsibility of the Escalation/Follow-Up Team to handle responses from the brand. This means we don’t need to reply to the customer ourselves with a resolution from the brand, we simply initiate the escalation.
When the escalation is resolved by the follow-up team, you’ll see a message like this: “Thanks for your patience, I just heard back from the team –” This will be followed by the brand’s response and any next steps or resolutions they’ve provided.
These responses will appear just like any other message from a Concierge agent, but the content will specifically address the issue that was escalated.
Once the issue has been resolved and the response is received, the conversation will be de-escalated by the follow-up team, and the green banner you saw earlier will disappear.
Let’s look at an example on the UI [LIVE DEMO]

De-escalating
Removing an active escalation when it’s been resolved or is no longer needed.
Click the Escalation button (it will be highlighted in green to show that that there’s an active escalation) or use the shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + E
How to de-escalate?
If the customer confirms their issue has been resolved and they no longer need assistance
If we’re correcting an unwarranted escalation and realize we have the resources to help the customer or were supposed to direct them to CS instead
If a customer provides crucial new information after an escalation, we should de-escalate and then re-escalate with the updated details in the summary
Otherwise, never de-escalate a conversation!
When to de-escalate?
De-escalating is the process of removing an active escalation when the issue has been resolved or is no longer needed.
How to De-Escalate: To de-escalate, click the Escalation button (it will be highlighted in green to indicate an active escalation). Alternatively, you can use the shortcut Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + E.
When to De-Escalate:
When the customer confirms their issue has been resolved and they no longer need assistance. In this case, you can safely remove the escalation.
If we’re correcting an unwarranted escalation: This can happen if we realize that we had the resources to help the customer all along, or if the customer should have been directed to customer support (CS) instead.
If a customer provides crucial new information after an escalation, we should de-escalate the conversation and then re-escalate it with the updated details in the summary.
Important: If none of these conditions apply, never de-escalate a conversation! Escalating is meant to ensure the customer receives the right support, and if we’re not sure, it’s best to leave it in the hands of the Escalation/Follow-Up Team.

Escalating Should Be the Last Step 
Unless instructed otherwise, only escalate after checking the UI, website and other credible brand resources
Ensure To Escalate Properly
Gather required info (depending on the type of escalation) → Shift + E → Paraphrase the issue → Notify the customer after escalating
Don’t Worry About Handling Responses
The Follow-Up Team handles escalations, your job is to only action the escalation when necessary
Know When To De-escalate  
Only de-escalate if the issue is fully resolved or if you need to update with new info before re-escalating
