As agents, one of the most important tasks we have is helping customers find exactly what they’re looking for. This can mean helping them search the website, providing accurate product recommendations, or guiding them to the right features and specifications.
We’re going to walk through how to search for products efficiently using the website’s tools, as well as how to handle different types of product inquiries that customers might have. Let's start with the basics of product searches, so we can ensure our responses are quick and accurate.

These steps ensure every response is accurate, personalized, and leads to a smooth resolution. By gathering the right details first, we avoid redundant questions, provide clear answers, and create a better customer experience.
Probing
If necessary, ask relevant follow-up questions for context



Scan for key details – Quickly review the conversation history to identify important information such as order numbers, specific product inquiries, past troubleshooting steps, or promotions. 
Check for unresolved issues or misguidance – Look for any concerns that haven’t been fully addressed or instances where the customer may have received conflicting or incorrect information. If necessary, clarify and correct any misguidance.
Look for tone cues – Pay attention to how the customer is expressing themselves. Are they frustrated, or excited? Matching their tone appropriately (with empathy or enthusiasm) helps make the conversation feel more natural and personalized.
How to effectively backread
Backreading
It gives full context and understanding about an issue 
Avoids repetition and redundant questions 
Ensures continuity 
Why is it important?



Backreading
Review the conversation history as far back as is necessary to fully understand and resolve the current issue. 
At a minimum, you should review messages from the same day. 
If the concern appears to be part of an ongoing or recurring issue, you should read further back to gather relevant context.
How Far Back Should We Backread?



Escalation preferences can give guidance on which topics to escalate or send to cs if we don’t find enough relevant info when researching. 
Promo notes provide details on active deals, their exclusions, and expiration dates. Checking these ensures we give accurate info when handling discount-related questions.
Checking notes is crucial when responding to conversations, as they often contain key context, and brand-specific guidelines that can speed up research and help you resolve issues more efficiently and accurately.

Searching templates is an essential step in quickly finding accurate info on any topic we encounter. 
By using the search bar and relevant keywords, we can efficiently locate the relevant templates that best address the customer's question.
We need to tailor templates if necessary to only leave relevant parts for the customer. 

     Templates
Availability
Examples
Recommendations
Compatibility
Features
Comparisons






Identify the most relevant words or phrases whether they’re clear or hidden in context.
Keywords
1




Sometimes, searching for the exact keyword may not return relevant templates. 

In these cases, it’s important to think of alternative words or phrases that have similar meanings.

How To Use Them




Not all customer scenarios or questions will be fully covered by a single template.

Learn to combine multiple relevant templates if necessary to provide a complete and helpful response.
Mix & Match

Templates are a starting point, but it’s important to adjust and tailor them to fit each customer’s situation. 

This means removing any parts that aren’t relevant, and making sure the tone feels natural and empathetic.

How To Use Them



External Resources
When we can’t find answers on the UI, the next step is to check the website. This involves reviewing FAQs, help libraries, product pages, blogs or relevant web pages to gather the necessary information.
Website
We should never use the brand’s chat/live support to get info!





Focus on clear, specific keywords related to the product
Avoid vague or overly broad terms that could return unrelated results
If you’re not seeing relevant items, try adjusting your wording (e.g. use “sofa” instead of “couch”)
Include brand names, SKU/model numbers, or collection names if mentioned by the customer

The website search bar is one of the fastest tools for locating specific products or categories. But to get the most accurate results, it’s important to be strategic with how you search.

Filters help you quickly narrow large sets of products down to the most relevant options, especially when a customer gives you a few specifics to work with.

When using this feature we should: 

Apply filters based on what the customer mentioned (size, color, price, or features). 
Mention the filters used so the customer knows what they’re viewing (e.g., “Here are the waterproof options in your size”).

The product page is where you’ll find all the key info about a specific item. It includes details like the product description, features, sizing, availability, price, shipping info, and more. This page is your go-to source for answering most product-related questions.
Product Pages
Tips for navigating effectively
Skim key details: Start with the product title, description, and key specs to quickly identify relevant info
Use Ctrl + F: Search keywords from the customer’s message to locate specific details faster
Check availability: Pay attention to out-of-stock notices, shipping time,  or unavailable options in size/color dropdowns

Tips for navigating effectively
Confirm essential info: Double-check compatibility, dimensions, or other relevant details


Search the Q&A section: Review similar questions asked and only trust answers provided by the brand for accurate info.

If the company’s website is difficult to navigate, we can use Google or other search engines to find relevant info. Simply paste the brand’s website URL followed by keywords related to what we’re searching for. The first few results will usually lead us to the info we need.

If we cannot find any info on the website we can move on to the brand’s official social media pages. They can give us info about the latest updates, promotions or product releases.

        Probing



Probing means asking thoughtful follow-up questions to fully understand the customer's issue or gather more information to resolve issues quickly.

What Is It?
You don’t need to ask follow-up questions for every message - only when it’s necessary to move the conversation forward.

When To Probe 
The message is unclear or incomplete
The message is too ambiguous or open to interpretation
The info provided is not enough to resolve the issue
 There’s a problem! Help. 
The order is not what I expected.  
It won’t let me checkout. 
Examples

Tailor your questions to what they said
1
Refer directly to the customer’s message to show we’re paying attention. This helps avoid generic or confusing questions and makes it easier for them to respond directly.
Use all available information to guide your questions
2
Leverage previous messages, the UI, website, Google or other research methods. This shows you’re thoughtfully piecing together the situation and asking precise questions.
Add context and reasoning to your ask
3
Explain why you need more details or what you’re trying to clarify. This reassures the customer you’re working toward a solution.
Use the “If-so” method when guessing
4
When you’re making an educated guess, phrase your question like, “Are you referring to [X]? If so, [info found].” This helps the customer easily confirm correct info and avoids back and forth.
        Probing
Asking The Right Questions

What To Avoid? 

Asking vague or generic questions
Avoid questions like “Can you clarify?” or “What do you mean?” without context. They can frustrate customers.

Asking for info we already have
Double-check the resources available like previous texts, and the customer profile.

Sounding robotic or scripted
Avoid copy-pasting generic phrases that don’t fit the flow of the conversation

Sending multiple separate messages asking one question at a time
Combine your questions clearly in one message to keep the conversation efficient.

TV working fine yday but now it’s just, frzen idk. no loading anythinf.
 I’m sorry for the trouble. Just to make sure I understand, is your TV frozen and not loading anything? If so, do you see any error message? And do you mind sending me the model number as well? That way I’ll be able to look into the issue for you. 
 Can you please clarify what you mean?

The funnel method is a way to guide customers from a broad product request to a more specific solution. 
You share a general link to a relevant collection or category, and ask follow-up questions to narrow down the options based on their preferences.

Funnel Method

There are some cases where customers text in a language other than English. In those cases, we’re still expected to help them as normal, just with a few extra steps!

Language Barriers 
1
Look for any notes or company guidelines in the UI on how to handle these
2
If there are no notes, use Google Translate to understand their message
3
Once you have a response, translate it back to the customer’s original language and send!
