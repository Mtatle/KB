 Handling AI Conversations

 AI indicates that a conversation has been escalated, or prepares for an escalation, but no actual follow-up or resolution has taken place, leaving the customer’s issue unaddressed.
Escalations
 AI sends replies to customers who were supposed to be unsubscribed, blocked, or marked “do not reply,” resulting in unwanted or non-compliant messaging.

Responding to DNR 
 AI explicitly labels its responses as coming from a bot (“I’m an automated helper” or “automated system”), disrupting the human support experience.
