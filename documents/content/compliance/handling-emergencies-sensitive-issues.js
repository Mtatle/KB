Overview
Our Role
 Respond warmly and compassionately without overstepping
 Avoid medical or personal advice; focus on brand-relevant help
Some conversations may involve customers sharing emotionally charged, medically sensitive, or high-risk situations. In these moments, the tone and boundaries of the response matter just as much as the content. The goal is always to respond with empathy, maintain professionalism, and prioritize safety - while staying within the appropriate scope of the role.
Redirect When Needed
 Share approved resources or loop in the right team
Acknowledge With Care

    Golden Rules
Do’s
Don’ts
Show clear, calm empathy
Overshare your own experiences and stay in off-topic conversations
Offer medical, legal, or emotional advice
Ask intrusive or personal questions
Provide approved hotline or support resources
Redirect after showing care
Close respectfully when support has been exhausted and it’s outside our scope
Be abrupt, salesy, or defensive

Mental health-related messages can range from expressions of emotional distress to direct statements about self-harm or suicidal thoughts. While these moments can be difficult to navigate, it’s important to respond with calm empathy, and avoid making assumptions.
 Mental Health Crises
Stay Calm and Empathetic
Share Crises Resources
Do Not Stay in Crisis Conversations
 Respond with care and acknowledge the customer’s feelings without judgment or panic.
If the message suggests emotional distress or possible self-harm, share a trusted hotline, using the “suc” template
After showing care and sharing resources, do not stay engaged in conversations that go beyond your role. You can close instead.
Do not ask questions about intent or make casual remarks like “It’ll get better”

Loss-related messages may include the death of a loved one. These moments require extra sensitivity and care. The goal is to acknowledge the customer’s experience with empathy, and avoid sales language.
       Loss or Grief
Acknowledge Loss With Care
Gently Redirect if Needed
Use warm, respectful language to express sympathy. Keep it brief and sincere, using the “ls” template
Avoid Product Talk or Sales Language
Don’t suggest purchases even if the conversation is brand-related. Unless the customer is asking for recommendations,  this is not the time to pivot the conversation.
If the customer is looking for help related to their order, products or account, shift the conversation back with empathy.

Customers may sometimes hint at or disclose situations involving domestic violence, abuse, or unsafe living conditions. These disclosures require careful, nonjudgmental responses focused on safety and support, while maintaining clear boundaries
     Unsafe Environments
Listen & Empathize 
Share trusted resources
Do Not Probe or Investigate

Show understanding and compassion. Acknowledge what the customer is sharing without judgment and, validate their feelings while maintaining professionalism.
Avoid asking for additional details or pressing for information. The goal is to support, not to gather evidence or assess the situation, which is outside your role.
When appropriate, provide links or contact info for verified support services (e.g., domestic violence hotlines). 
Keep all information shared strictly confidential, sharing only with authorized internal teams if guidance needed. Respect the customer’s privacy at all times.
After providing empathy and resources, end the interaction and don’t engage further. 

At times, customers may open up about personal challenges that are unrelated to the brand - such as loneliness, relationship issues, or financial stress. While it's important to acknowledge their message with kindness, these conversations should be gently redirected back to brand-relevant topics
     Personal Issues
After empathizing, guide the conversation back to the brand or the reason they originally reached out.
Respond with empathy to show the customer they’ve been heard and respected.

Gently Redirect
Lead with Kindness
If the customer continues to overshare after two gentle redirections, it’s appropriate to close the conversation.

political views, religious beliefs, personal ideologies, or social opinions
Sometimes customers include personal opinions, political views, or inappropriate language in their messages. While it’s important to remain respectful, our role is to stay focused on brand-related topics and not engage in conversations outside our scope.
  Out-of-Scope Commentary
If the customer shares commentary unrelated to the brand, and there’s no relevant question or issue
Political, Personal, or Unrelated Opinions

hate speech, slurs, or discriminatory language
