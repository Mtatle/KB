In this video we’ll walkthrough Concierge's system navigation. We’ll go through the essential features of the Concierge dashboard, relevant tabs and the conversation page. We’ll cover tools that help you manage conversations, ensuring you're fully equipped to deliver excellent customer support.
Let’s begin with the Dashboard Features.
Dashboard Features: These are the essential tools within the dashboard that allow you to manage conversations, control your availability, and access escalated issues. This is the first section you’ll see when you log in, so let’s walk through each feature step-by-step.
The first feature is the Queue section, which has two important parts:
All Conversations: This shows all chats in the queue that are waiting to be assigned to an agent.
My Conversations: This section shows only the chats assigned to your personal queue.
Next, we have the Availability Toggle. This allows you to set your status as either "Available" or "Unavailable." Setting your status to "Available" means you’ll receive new conversations in your queue. Setting it to "Unavailable" will prevent new chats from being assigned to you.
Then, we have the Start Sending Button. This button will appear when you're available, and when chats are assigned to your queue. Clicking it will take you to the conversation page, where you can start interacting with customers.




Shows all escalated conversations in chronological order, and has a filter feature. 

Escalations Section
Dashboard Features

This section displays your name and includes a sign-out option for when you need to log out.
Sign-Out Feature

Next is the Escalations Section. This section shows all escalated conversations in chronological order, with a filter feature. Escalated conversations are those that are forwarded to the brand’s cs team to help resolve if our resources are limited. We’ll cover escalations in detail in another video, but for now, just know that this section allows you to see all of them listed. 
Lastly, we have the Sign Out Feature. This section displays your name, and it includes a sign-out option for when you need to log out of the system. You’ll use this feature when you're finished working.
At this point, I’ll switch over to a live demo of the dashboard.

Drop down list that allows you  to filter feedback by recipient name
Contains comments left by brands about how we handled their customer conversations
The Feedback tab is where you’ll find comments left by brands about how we’ve handled customer conversations. This is an important section as it helps you improve your performance based on feedback.
Within the Feedback Tab, there’s a Needs Review Tab. This tab shows a list of feedback that has not yet been reviewed by the Ops Team. It’s helpful to check here for feedback that still needs to be addressed.
There’s also a Search Feature that lets you filter feedback by type (positive or negative) and a dropdown list that allows you to filter feedback by recipient name—the agent who received the feedback.
Next is the Handled Section. This tab shows feedback that has already been reviewed and handled by the Ops Team. 

Contains comments left by brands about how we handled their customer conversations
Example
Name of brand and link that leads to company profile
Feedback note with a link to the conversation where it was given.
Feedback Tab
Let’s look at some examples: The feedback here includes details such as:
Timestamp
The company or brand (with a link leading to their profile)
The type of feedback (positive or negative)
The subject or topic of the feedback
The feedback note itself, which includes a link to the conversation where the feedback was left
The recipient of the feedback
The reviewer (Ops Team member)
Who viewed the feedback.
It’s important to note that you don’t need to worry too much about the feedback tab, as the Ops Team will mainly handle it. You’ll be notified if there’s any specific feedback for you to address.
Now, I’ll show you what this looks like in Concierge.

Templates are pre-written messages designed to streamline communication and improve efficiency by providing consistent, quick responses to common customer inquiries.

What are Templates? Templates are pre-written messages designed to streamline communication and improve efficiency by providing consistent, quick responses to common customer inquiries. They help ensure that responses are accurate, on-brand, and timely.
What are Template Requests? Template Requests allow you to request new templates if you find there’s a need for a response not covered by existing templates. These requests are reviewed and approved by the Ops Team before being added for use.
The Needs Review Tab in the Templates section shows a list of requests that are yet to be reviewed by the Ops Team. There’s also a Search Bar that allows you to search for requests by title, company name, or the body of the request.
Then there’s the Reviewed Section. This shows a list of requests that have been approved or denied by the Ops Team. 

Example

Templates Tab

Now, let’s move on to Global Templates.
These are universal templates available across all brands, covering frequently asked questions and general scenarios that apply to multiple clients.
Then we also have another type: 
Brand-Specific Templates: These are templates that are unique to each brand. They cover specific policies, promotions, processes, and product-related information for that particular brand.
We’ll dive deeper into both types of templates in later training sessions. But for now, I’ll show you where you can find all global templates in the system.
You can search for templates by title in the Global Templates Tab. The system lists all global templates along with their title, body, last edited date (only Ops can edit them), the type (global), and visibility (whether they can be seen on the UI). You’ll also see the shortcut key for each template, which we’ll discuss later on.
Make sure to not click on the “Create Template” button. That’s for authorized team members only.
Now let’s see them in real-time [LIVE DEMO]

Each brand’s name is displayed with a link to their profile, their unique company ID, display name, and official website.

When you click on a company’s profile, you’ll be able to view all their templates (both brand-specific and global), any notes they have that give instructions on how to handle conversations, any promotions, blocked words, and other settings related to their profile. 
Please note, don’t edit anything on the company profile page. The important aspects you need to focus on during customer interactions will be shown on the conversation page, which I’ll explain next. Also, ignore the “Request Template” button here—there’s another way to request templates, which we’ll cover later.
