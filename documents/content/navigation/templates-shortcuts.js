What is a Template?
Templates are pre-written, canned responses the Agent Team uses to address common questions or issues efficiently. They are a fundamental tool for providing consistent, accurate, and quick responses.
The most commonly used templates are assigned keyboard shortcuts (usually a series of 2-4 letters). When entered in the message reply box followed by a space, the shortcut automatically expands to show the full template text, saving significant time.
The shortcuts can usually be found in the upper right-hand corner of the template box in the UI:
  
  

It is important to note that not all Global and Brand-specific templates have shortcuts.
	

There are two template categories
Templates are organized to provide both general and specific information. Understanding these categories is key to selecting the most appropriate response.
1. Global Templates (or All-brand templates)
* Description: These are general responses available regardless of which brand conversation you are in. They cover broad, common inquiries (e.g., "How did you get my number?", simple thank yous) or standard procedures applicable to most brands (e.g., checking spam folders).
* Scope: They cover broad, common inquiries (e.g., "How did you get my number?", simple thank yous) or standard procedures applicable to most brands (e.g., checking spam folders). They are designed for situations where brand-specific details are not required.
* Source: These are typically created centrally based on common interactions across all clients.
* Appearance: Identified by a yellow background in the template list within the UI.
* Usage: Meant for quick answers to general questions or when no Brand-Specific template covers the situation. 
2. Brand-Specific Templates
* Usage Precedence: Brand-Specific templates ALWAYS take precedence over Global templates. If a Brand-Specific template exists that addresses the customer's question or issue, you must use it. This ensures the most accurate and client-approved information is shared. Global templates are only for use in the absence of a relevant Brand-Specific option.
* Description: These templates are tailored to a specific brand and provide nuanced information that varies greatly between clients. This includes details on shipping, returns, specific products, unique promotions, escalation procedures, etc.
* Appearance: Identified by a white background in the template list.
* Scope: The number and type of Brand-Specific templates can vary significantly based on the brand's complexity, products, and policies.
* Source: Often created from brand FAQs, blogs, official website information, and specific client instructions.
* Mandatory Templates: Within Brand-Specific templates, there are 15 core "Mandatory Templates" covering essential topics like shipping, returns, customer support contact, sizing, etc. Familiarizing yourself with these is crucial. (See "Mandatory Templates" section below).

How to Utilize Templates
Following a consistent process ensures you select and use templates efficiently and accurately.
1. Search with Keywords
* Identify keywords from the customer’s message (e.g., "refund," "shipping," "size," "cancel").
* Use single, relevant keywords in the template search bar for best results (searching 'refund' is better than "how do I get a refund?").
* If the exact word yields no results, try synonyms, related phrases, or combinations (e.g., for "kids," try "children" or "age limit").
2. Use Recommended Templates
* The Concierge app often suggests relevant templates based on the customer's message context (indicated by a yellow lightning bolt icon).
* While these recommendations are helpful starting points, always use your best judgment to ensure the suggested template is genuinely relevant to the specific nuance of the customer's inquiry.
  

3. Edit/Personalize Per Scenario
* Templates are a starting point, NOT the final message. They are often generic and need tailoring.
* ALWAYS edit the template to:
   1. Match the specific scenario and conversation flow.
   2. Remove unnecessary information or questions already answered.
   3. Add personalization (customer's name, reference their specific item/order).
   4. Ensure a friendly, natural, and empathetic tone (matching brand guidelines).
   5. Proofread for clarity, grammar, and typos after editing.
Example: when a customer asks to cancel their order, we use the "ced" template
  

This template also covers order edits. To fit the situation, we will edit the template as follows: 

Before editing: "I can check if that's possible. What's the order number, email, and the change you'd like?": 


After editing: “I can check if that's possible. What's the order number and email address and the change you'd like to make?”
Importance of Templates and Shortcuts
* Efficiency: Templates and especially their shortcuts drastically reduce response time, allowing you to handle more conversations effectively (improving SPH). Memorizing common shortcuts, particularly for Mandatory Templates, is highly recommended.
* Accuracy & Consistency: They ensure you provide brand-approved, accurate information consistently across interactions.
* Reduces Errors: Using pre-written and vetted text minimizes typos and factual errors compared to typing everything manually.
* Foundation for Personalization: They provide the core information, freeing you up to focus on the crucial steps of personalizing the message and adding empathy.


General Best Practices & Tips for Templates
* Search First: Always try searching for a template before typing a response from scratch.
* Prioritize Brand-Specific: Use Brand-Specific templates over Global ones whenever available and relevant.
* Memorize Key Shortcuts: Focus on Mandatory Template shortcuts and those you use frequently.
* EDIT, EDIT, EDIT: Never send a template without reviewing and tailoring it to the specific conversation. Add personalization and empathy.
* Check Template Updates: Be aware that templates can be updated; use the most current version available in the UI.
* Request Templates: If you frequently encounter a situation not covered by a template, use the "Request Template" feature to help build the knowledge base. Ensure your request is clear, sourced, and potentially useful for others.
