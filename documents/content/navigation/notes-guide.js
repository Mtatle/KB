Workflow Guidelines
Presence of "Immediately"
* If "immediately" is mentioned in the note, do not troubleshoot and follow the instructions directly.
   * Example: Send to CS immediately for post-purchase inquiries.
* If "immediately" is not mentioned in the note, you should troubleshoot first. If unresolved, follow the note's instructions.
   * Example: Send to CS for post-purchase inquiries.
Replacing "Error" with "Issue"
* "Issues" refer to any technical problems, operational challenges, or any scenario that requires troubleshooting to resolve the problem.
   * This would encompass: cancellation and order edits, retroactive discounts, code errors, account login difficulties, reward points/discounts redemption difficulties, etc.
   * Example: Customer's code is not working; the order is late; the order arrived damaged.
Notes Indicating Preferences
* Notes marked with the  üÖøÔ∏è emoji signify preferred workflows. While these workflows are recommended, they don't need to be followed rigidly, and the conversation should not be manipulated to fit them. However, if the context of the conversation allows, it is mandatory to adhere to the note.
   * Example: If customers are looking for an outfit recommendation/item pairing, direct them to the ‚Äúshop the look‚Äù section on each product page 

Closing Conversations When the Client Takes Over


   * If the client responds directly to the customer, indicated by a white message bubble (not an automated journey message) and there's a note in the conversation saying to ‚ÄúClose the convo once the client takes over‚Äù, then we begin by checking whether it‚Äôs past 4 PM EST since the day the customer first responded to the latest client message.
   * Before 4 PM (EST)
   * We should not engage further with the customer before 4 PM EST, and we should close the conversation instead. This allows the client to continue the conversation.
   * Only if another agent has already responded to the customer, even if they weren‚Äôt supposed to, we do not close. Instead, we pick up from where they left off and continue helping the customer as normal.
   * After 4 PM (EST)
   * It‚Äôs okay to respond and proceed to help the customer as normal. From that point on, we can engage with the customer as long as the client hasn‚Äôt replied again.`
