Frustrated Customers
When a customer is frustrated or sharing sad news, tone matters even more. Using overly casual or expressive language may come off as dismissive or insincere. In these cases, even if the tone is Casual or Super Casual always default to the Polished tone
Tone for Frustrated Customers

Casual
Polished


Even though the tone is Super Casual, we will avoid casual language in this case, as the customer is frustrated 
Instead, we will maintain a Polished tone to demonstrate that we take their concerns seriously
