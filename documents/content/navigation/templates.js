Why They Matter
Pre-written responses designed to help agents quickly and consistently address common customer inquiries. They streamline communication, allowing agents to focus on providing personalized support. 
Definition
Ensure consistency and accuracy in responses - Templates provide standardized language and information, ensuring that every agent gives the same accurate responses to similar customer questions. 
Save time and improve efficiency - Agents can reply to common inquiries much faster, reducing the time spent crafting individual replies and allowing them to handle more customers.
 Maintain brand voice and tone - Some templates are designed to reflect the company’s unique style and messaging, ensuring that every response is aligned with the brand's values and tone.
Reduce errors and guesswork - By providing pre-approved answers, templates minimize the risk of incorrect information or phrasing.
Benefits 
Let’s talk about why templates actually matter.
Templates are pre-written responses designed to help agents quickly and consistently address common customer inquiries. They make communication easier and more efficient so that you can focus on providing personalized support where it matters most.
Here’s why they’re important:
 They ensure consistency and accuracy — Templates use approved language and information, so every agent is delivering the same clear, accurate message to customers.
 They save time and improve efficiency — Instead of typing out the same reply over and over, templates let you respond faster and handle more chats without sacrificing quality.
They maintain the brand’s voice and tone — Many templates are crafted to match the brand’s personality and values, helping you sound on-brand every time.
They reduce errors and guesswork — Because the information is pre-approved, you don’t have to second-guess how to phrase something or worry about giving the wrong details.
Overall, templates are here to help you work smarter  -  so you can focus your energy on personalizing and supporting each customer.

Now, let’s go over the three types of templates you’ll see in Concierge:
1. Brand-Specific Templates These templates are created specifically for one brand. They match the brand’s voice, style, and often include details like loyalty perks, exclusive promos, or policies that only apply to that brand. You should always prioritize these templates first  to ensure accuracy and a personalized experience for the customer. You’ll recognize them easily — they show up in white.
2. Global or All-Brand Templates These are general templates that can apply to any brand. They’re written in a neutral tone and don’t include brand-specific information. You should only use these when there isn’t a brand-specific template available for the specific topic. They appear in yellow so you can quickly spot them.
3. Recommended Templates These are the system’s suggestions based on what the customer is saying and what it thinks is the most relevant response.. Usually they show up at the top of the template lists for visibility. They could be either brand-specific or global. You’ll know them by the yellow and black lightning bolt icon in the corner. Recommended templates can help you move faster, but always double-check if they’re actually relevant to the convo. 
So remember - the priority is: Brand-Specific first, Global if needed, and Recommended when it makes sense. The goal is to keep your responses accurate, efficient, and always aligned with the brand.

Identify the most relevant words or phrases whether they’re clear or hidden in context.

Keywords

Sometimes, searching for the exact keyword may not return relevant templates. 

In these cases, it’s important to think of alternative words or phrases that have similar meanings.
Search Synonyms

Let’s talk about how to actually use templates effectively.
First - Use Keywords. When searching for a template, start by identifying the most relevant words or phrases in the customer’s message. These keywords may be obvious, like ‘refund’ or ‘order status’ — but sometimes, they’ll be hidden in the context. So, read carefully and figure out what the customer is really asking.
Second - Try Synonyms. If you search using a keyword and nothing helpful comes up, think about other ways a customer might phrase their question or words with similar meanings. For example, instead of ‘refund,’ they might say ‘money back’ or ‘return my payment.’ Searching for synonyms can help you find the right template faster.




Not all customer scenarios or questions will be fully covered by a single template.

Learn to combine multiple relevant templates if necessary to provide a complete and helpful response.

Mix & Match

Templates are a starting point, but it’s important to adjust and tailor them to fit each customer’s situation. 

This means removing any parts that aren’t relevant, and making sure the tone feels natural and empathetic.

Try to memorize shortcuts for common templates to boost your efficiency!
Third - Mix and Match When Needed. Not every customer scenario will be fully covered by a single template. It’s completely okay to combine multiple relevant templates to give the customer a complete and helpful response. Just make sure the templates you stack together make sense and flow naturally.
And finally - Tailor Your Templates. Templates are just a starting point. It’s important to edit them based on the customer’s specific situation. Remove any parts that don’t apply, and personalize the message so it sounds natural, empathetic, and human.
The better you get at these steps, the smoother and faster your conversations will be - without losing that personal touch.
Before we jump into a quick demo, one last tip -  Many of our most common templates have shortcuts assigned to them. These shortcuts allow you to insert a full template instantly, so it’s really helpful to try and memorize them. It’ll save you time and help you reply faster without searching every time.
Now, let’s move over to the platform so I can quickly show you how to access and use templates. [LIVE DEMO]
You’ll find the template section on the right-hand side of your screen. At the top, you’ll see the brand-specific templates and the recommended templates - these should always be your first choice because they’re tailored for the brand and conversation. Below that, you’ll find the global templates, which are more general and can be used if no brand-specific option is available.
You can also use the toggle button to expand or minimize the template list depending on what you need.
If you’re looking for something specific, use the search bar at the top of the template section -  type in a keyword related to the customer’s question, and relevant templates will show up.
You’ll notice that some templates have a shortcut keys displayed at the top-right corner. Once you know the shortcut, you can type it directly into the chat box and hit the space bar — the template will automatically appear, saving you even more time.
And of course, you can also insert a template by simply clicking on it from the template list.

Requesting Templates

If you come across helpful information from credible brand sources (like the brand’s website, FAQs, or official social channels) that isn’t already in an existing template but could be useful for multiple customers, you can request a new template.
 When to Request?
Send the message with the new information to the customer.
Click the three dots on the top right corner of the text. 

Select Request Template and fill out the form.
How to Request?
Insert title of the template
Edit body of template
Insert source and other notes
Let’s jump into when and how to request a new template.
When do you request a new template? If you come across helpful information that could be useful for multiple customers  and it’s from a credible source like the brand’s official website, FAQs, or social media channels -  but it’s not already available in an existing template, it’s a good idea to request a new one. This will help you and your fellow agents save a lot of time when you come across the same scenarios for the brand.
How do you request a new template? Here’s how you can do it:
Send the message with the new information to the customer.
Next, click the three dots on the top-right corner of the message box.
From the options, select Request Template and fill out the form with the relevant details.
Once you submit it, the new template will be reviewed and the Ops team will either deny or approve it. It’ll pop up in the templates tab. 
Let’s jump over to the platform, to see it in action. [LIVE DEMO]
There’s also a way for you to make and personalize your own templates for day to day use, but that will be cover later on in training.

Especially when you memorize the shortcuts for the ones frequently used
Brand-specific templates take precedence
Global templates are only a backup if no brand-specific option exists
