When to Blocklist a Customer

What is Blocklisting?
Why is it Important?
Helps maintain a safe and respectful environment. We do not tolerate unwanted or inappropriate behavior, and blocking ensures that individuals who engage in such conduct can no longer reach out to us
Respectful Environment
Blocking protects us from potential threats like spam, and malware scams, safeguarding both our team and our systems from harmful activities. Customers will however  be able to receive messages unless they choose to unsubscribe or block our number as well
Potential Threats 
Blocking a customer means they will no longer be able to contact Concierge. Any messages they send will not be placed in the queue for us to respond. Additionally, once a customer is blocked, we will no longer be able to send messages to them. However, this does not prevent them from receiving Attentive marketing messages

When to Blocklist?
When deciding whether to block a customer, the key factor is intent. We need to assess whether the customer's language is meant to express frustration about a situation or personally attack, degrade, harm us as customer support representative and just generally be vulgar
We’re not just blocking swear words, we’re blocking when they are used in a personal, or degrading manner. If they are using them in an non-negative way, with no malicious intent we can respond

What Behavior Warrants a Block?
A customer should be blocked if they send us a message that doesn’t align with our company interests. The types of behaviors we block are:
Inappropriate Behavior
Suspicious Behavior
Generally Offensive
Explicit
Abusive / Harassing
Scam Images
Spamming

Criteria for Blocklisting
When a customer personally attacks or harasses us through messages, their intent is to degrade, intimidate, or provoke a reaction
The customer is using slurs, hate speech, or taboo language in a way that is offensive to a group of people or society in general
Abusive / Harassing
Generally Offensive

Sexually explicit messages, images, videos, or suggestive comments, whether directed at you or in general

Criteria for Blocklisting
Images sent by customers that are designed to look like a video play button, but are actually disguised scams or ads
Scam Images
    Don’t open or click on any unknown links or images the customer sends through

Criteria for Blocklisting
There are 2 types of spam message that we should block
Spamming
Customer spams/sends at least ten (10) unrelated messages in a single day
Customer sends multiple unrelated messages over three separate days
 
 
Unrelated messages include shopping lists, YouTube or TikTok videos, random words, messages meant for someone else, etc
If the message history shows unrelated messages on at least two different days, we should block on the third day this occurs again

When not to Blocklist?
A customer that is upset about an issue and uses strong language to vent frustration about their experience, expressing dissatisfaction with products or services should not be blocked
How to handle this?
 If we can help:
 If beyond our control:
Empathize: Acknowledge their frustration or concerns
Probe: Ask follow-up questions to better understand the issue
Resolve: Work towards a solution whenever possible
