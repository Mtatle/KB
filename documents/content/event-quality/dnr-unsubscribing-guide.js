When to Unsubscribe a Customer

When To Unsubscribe
Why is it Important?
Privacy laws require businesses to honor opt-out requests immediately. Failing to comply can result in fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage. Proper handling protects the company from legal trouble and maintains compliance
Legal & Business Risks
Customer Respect
Customers have the right to control the messages they receive. Ignoring their request can lead to frustration, complaints, and loss of trust. Acting promptly ensures a positive experience and maintains brand integrity
Unsubscribing is the process of removing a customer from receiving any further messages (Attentive marketing messages & live agent), usually in response to their request. This is crucial for respecting customer preferences, complying with privacy laws, and avoiding potential legal issues. If a customer asks to unsubscribe, we must act immediately and without further engagement

How To Unsubscribe
Shift + D
Drop-Down Menu
Keyboard Shortcut

Why Immediately?
It’s Not a Choice, It’s the Law
Unsubscribing is not about engagement—it’s a legal requirement
One Mistake = Big Consequences
No Room for Judgment!
The System Handles It
Laws mandate instant action—not negotiation, not confirmation, just do it
Even one extra message after an opt-out can be a violation that leads to fines or lawsuits
Some customers actively look for violations to report or sue—don’t give them the chance
If an unsubscribe request comes in, the safest action is immediate processing, no second thoughts
Just trust the system—if they’re out, they’re out. Once unsubscribed, the customer is automatically removed from messages

Why No Confirmation?
Worst case? They escalate with complaints, bad reviews, or legal action
If they’re out, they’re out
No manual follow-ups
No response = No violation
More Messages = More Complaints
Customers opting out are already disengaged—any further message frustrates them
Replying is a Spam Risk
The System Handles It For You
If a customer says "Stop texting me" or similar, any response—even confirmation—can legally count as an unwanted message
The last message they get is the automated opt-out confirmation

Criteria for Unsubscribing
We must immediately unsubscribe a customer if their message meets certain criteria. We do not engage with the customer before unsubscribing them. Once unsubscribed, they receive an automatic confirmation message
