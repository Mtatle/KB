When to Close a Conversation

What is Closing?
When do we close a conversation?
We close when we no longer need to reply to the customer. This is when the customer’s message does not warrant or need a reply
When do we not close a conversation?
We do not close any conversation with a customer that still needs assistance 
Closing a conversation means that no further action is needed for a certain conversation, and it is removed from the active queue, keeping the workspace focused on open chats
TO CLOSE
OR NOT TO CLOSE

How to Close?

Unsubbing or blocking conversations automatically closes conversations. You will not need to close the conversation again. Customers can also subscribe themselves and can continue to the conversation again

When It Might Be Okay to Respond
If they have a relevant question regarding the brand and also mention politics, only respond to the relevant brand issue/question
If a customer message is not clear but their question might be brand related

When not replying and closing conversations we should also check that we are following a note from the brand stating we should not reply in certain situations, avoid politically charged messages or sending a message to clarify what the customer meant when there was no indication it was for the brand
