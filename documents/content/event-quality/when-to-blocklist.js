When a customer is Blocklisted, they will no longer be able to contact Concierge agents. Any messages they send will be automatically filtered out and will not appear in our queue. Likewise, we will no longer be able to send Concierge replies to them. Blocklisting does not prevent the customer from receiving Attentive marketing messages. It only ends two-way communication through Concierge.
A customer should be Blocklisted if they send messages that are abusive, offensive, harassing, or otherwise inappropriate. This includes anything:
* Directly targeting Concierge agents in a personal or degrading way
* Using taboo, explicit, or hostile language to provoke or intimidate
* Discriminatory or hateful language directed at a specific group of people
Blocklisting isn't just about bad language, it’s about how and why it’s used. We take action when a customer’s message shows clear intent to offend, degrade, or harass.


How to Blocklist
  





Send the template titled 
“Inappropriate Content” (shortcut: CT). 








Do not interact with the customer any further. And continue to block the contact immediately


  

You can do this by using the keyboard shortcut Shift + B or the drop-down option next to the Close button on the conversation page.














When Not to Blocklist


We will not block a contact if the customer is only providing negative feedback about the products and services. Instead, we will empathize, probe, and work with them toward a resolution. If we cannot proactively resolve the customer's feedback, we can let the customer know that we appreciate their time for sharing their feedback and express how we’ll consider it for future improvements.

When We Can Block a Customer Immediately
In certain cases, we may block a customer right away, without using the CT template, if their behavior clearly violates engagement guidelines. Below are the specific scenarios where immediate blocking is appropriate:
1. Spamming with unrelated messages (10 or more in a single day)
If a customer sends at least ten (10) unrelated messages in one day, we should block them.
Unrelated messages include things like:

   * Shopping lists
   * YouTube or TikTok videos
   * Random words or emojis
   * Messages clearly intended for someone else

      2. Repeated unrelated messages across at least 2 separate days
If a customer has sent unrelated messages on at least two separate days, they should be blocked if the behavior continues on a third day. These unrelated messages must be observed across at least three distinct days, with no genuine questions or concerns in between.

      3. Image with a play button icon
If a customer sends an image with a play button overlaid (typically resembling a mobile game screenshot or suspicious content), do not click the image or open any downloads. These are often misleading or potentially harmful. Customers sending such images should be immediately blocked.

      4. Ad link with no prior message history
If a customer sends a promotional or advertising link without any previous context, no prior help requests, brand-related questions, or messages, this is grounds for immediate blocking.

         * An ad link refers to a URL promoting products, services, or offers not related to the brand.
         * This does not include promotional links for the brand itself, which are considered relevant.




Blocklist vs. Unsubscribe: Know the Difference
         * Shift + D (unsubscribe) and shift + B (blocklist) cannot be used interchangeably; learn more about when to unsubscribe here.
         * Due to legal reasons, we always prioritize the customer’s intent to unsubscribe over all other actions. If we have a customer message that is both an unsubscribe request and uses offensive language, we will unsubscribe (shift + D).
