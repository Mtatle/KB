    content: `When to Unsubscribe


Unsubscribing a customer from SMS messages is not optional, it is a legal obligation and must be done immediately in certain scenarios. This document is designed to help you make more informed decisions by giving you a clear understanding of the process, its importance, and the potential impact of not following it. 


1. Consent
	2. Legal Compliance
	 3. Consequences
	Customers must opt in to receive messages and can revoke that consent at any time
	Sending texts without consent violates strict privacy laws
	Lawsuits from customers for each message sent after opt-out. Which leads to large fines and damage to brand trust
	  

	  

	  

	

Our workflow is guided by strict legal requirements, which leaves us with two specific scenarios where unsubscribing is mandatory. 
1. The Customer Discloses They Are Under 13
Key Rule: If a customer explicitly states that they are under 13 years old, unsubscribe them immediately using Shift + D. We are legally prohibited from texting anyone under the age of 13.
Unsubscribe Examples:
  

	  

	  

	  

	Never ask for age confirmation or clarification. We will only unsubscribe if they tell us their exact age. If the customer only hints at being underage without clearly stating exactly how old they are, continue assisting them as usual.
2. The Customer Requests to Stop Receiving Texts (Explicitly or Implicitly)
Key Rule: If a customer expresses any intent to stop receiving SMS messages, directly, indirectly, or conditionally, we must unsubscribe them immediately using Shift + D.
Never respond to the message before unsubscribing. The platform will automatically send them a system-generated confirmation that they‚Äôve been unsubscribed.
Common Unsubscribe Requests
* Be vigilant and interpret language broadly. Below is a non-exhaustive list of phrases and patterns that indicate the customer wants to stop receiving texts. We have to be careful and look out for language such as (but not limited to):

   1. Opt me out
   2. Stop texting me / Stop sending me messages / Stop harassing me / Stop stalking me
   3. Remove my number
   4. Ôªø Pasted content Ôªø or ‚úã (any stop emoji)
   5. Stop it
   6. Wrong number
   7. Delete my information / This phone number is no longer in service
   8. Looking to see how I can unsubscribe
   9. I didn‚Äôt subscribe / You have the wrong person
   10. Stop sending this
   11. Remove
   12. How can I unsubscribe? / Can you help me unsubscribe? / Asking for instructions that indicate they are looking to unsubscribe / etc.
   13. Different typographical error variations of the word stop or unsubscribe:
      1. ST0P, STO0, atop, stp, stip, wtop, dtop, sto, srop, syop, stlp, stup, sto[, sto;, stol, sgop, st9p, st0p, s5op, s6op, ztop, stkp, sto-, stoo, etc.
Unsubsidized me, unsbscrbe, inscribe me, etc,
         14. Use of any of the following words: STOP, END, CANCEL, UNSUBSCRIBE, or QUIT
         15. Shut up! (or a variation)
         16. Leave me alone (or a variation)
         17. Unsubscribe me if you can‚Äôt answer my question / If you don‚Äôt solve my issue, unsubscribe me / If you don‚Äôt do this right now, stop texting me / etc.
         18. ‚ÄúNo need to send another message‚Äù in response to a marketing text
         19. If the customer sends ‚ÄúFuck You‚Äù or the emoji üñïto us
         20. GTFO, FU (and other abbreviations)
         21. Opt Out
         22. Revoke
         23. I‚Äôm blocking you
















Confusing Statements That Still Need to be Unsubscribed
         1. Conditional Statements:
If a customer indicates they want to unsubscribe only if something doesn‚Äôt happen, or they state they will unsubscribe in the future, unsubscribe them immediately using Shift + D.
These conditional statements are non-negotiable, as we cannot guarantee the outcomes.
Unsubscribe Examples:
  

	  

	  

	  

	         2. Abusive Language:
If a customer‚Äôs message includes both an opt-out and offensive language, we need to unsubscribe them using Shift + D. Even though offensive language does necessitate a block, an unsubscribe request always overrides any other action. 
Unsubscribe Examples:
  

	  



	         3. Customer Needs Help:


Even if the customer also has an issue or question alongside an unsubscribe request, do not engage before unsubscribing them. Once unsubscribed, they will receive an automated confirmation. If they want to continue the conversation, they must opt in again through the proper method.


         4. Previous Agent Did Not Unsubscribe:
If other agents failed to unsubscribe the customer after an unsubscribe request, and the conversation has continued. Regardless of how long ago the request was made, we are required to act on it for legal reasons. Always fully backread to ensure no opt-out request was missed.
Do not continue the conversation, immediately unsubscribe using Shift + D.



Exceptions Where It Might be Okay to Reply:


There are situations where you may reply to the customer instead of unsubscribing. However, these situations require sound judgment so before acting on it, we need to verify the request in the #team-deel channel.
         1. The customer is strictly asking what happens if they unsubscribe from texts.

            * Only proceed if the message is clearly asking a question about what would happen.

            *  If the customer is asking any other questions, eg. 
               1. ‚ÄúHow do I unsubscribe?‚Äù
               2. ‚ÄúCan I unsubscribe?‚Äù
               3. ‚ÄúWhen will you stop these?‚Äù
               *  Unsubscribe them immediately using Shift + D.

                  2. The customer is specifically asking what will happen if they unsubscribe from emails or how they can unsubscribe from emails.

                     * Only proceed if the message is clearly asking a question regarding email.

                     * If the message is not phrased as a question or they clearly state they wish to stop messaging as well, e.g.
                        1.  ‚ÄúUnsubscribe me from emails and texts‚Äù, 
                        2. ‚ÄúStop emails‚Äù, 
                        3. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want these texts, and how do I unsub from email?‚Äù
                        *  Unsubscribe them immediately using Shift + D.

                           3. The customer previously unsubscribed, then opted back in and now needs assistance.        
                           * Customers must opt in again through one of the following methods:
                           1. Re-entering their phone number on the signup unit.
                           2. Sending UNSTOP or START via text
        Example of a Customer Opting In:
  

If a customer has not opted in through one of these official channels, do not reply. They should not appear in the queue and are not eligible for follow-up.
                           4. The customer asks how we got their number, who we are, or why we‚Äôre texting them.

                              * There are cases where the customer is not asking to stop texts, but is seeking clarification on why we‚Äôre texting them.
                              1. In these cases, we use the TXT template instead of unsubscribing. 

                                 5. The customer expresses frustration about message volume or content. They ask for fewer messages, different messages, or ways to filter what they receive.

                                    * In some instances, the customer wants to reduce the types or number of messages they receive. Not outright stop them.
                                    1. In these cases, we use the TMT template instead of unsubscribing. 
                                    2. If the same concern is raised about emails, we should use the TME template instead.
However, if the customer mentions or implies they want the messages to stop completely, even temporarily, do not use TMT. Unsubscribe them instead.

Tips & Tricks
                                    * Do not post in the #team-deel channel for cases already covered here.
                                    * Do not confuse Shift + D (unsubscribe) with Shift + B (block). These serve different purposes. Learn more about when to block here.
