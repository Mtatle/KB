Unlike your day-to-day responses to customers, Events are situations where your actions matter more than your words. That means you won’t always need to send a message - instead, you’ll be taking behind-the-scenes actions like closing a conversation, unsubscribing someone, or blocklisting a number.
These are quick, important decisions that keep our queues clean and our experiences efficient - both for our team and for the customer. In this video, we’ll walk through each event type, starting with Closing Conversations.

Closing Conversations

Closing a conversation is the act of removing an active chat from the queue, that does not require any response from us.
We close if a conversation does not warrant any response from us based on the closing criteria. 

What does it mean?

We can close by clicking the “Close” button on the top right corner of the conversation page or using the shortcut Cmd/Ctrl + C or Shift + N

How to close
What does it mean? Closing a conversation simply means removing an active chat from the queue that doesn't need any response from us. Think of it as a clean-up step — no further action is needed, and the customer doesn’t need to hear from us. We only close chats that meet the closing criteria, meaning there’s no question, no request, and nothing to follow up on.
How do we close a conversation? You can close it in two quick ways: Click the “Close” button in the top-right corner of the conversation window, Or use a keyboard shortcut — Cmd or Ctrl + C, or Shift + N — whichever works best for you though I’d recommend memorizing the shortcuts.
These small actions help maintain a smooth, streamlined queue so we’re always focused on the conversations that matter.

When To Close





       A message is clearly not meant for us

This happens when a customer accidentally sends a text to the wrong number


1




       
       Our reply adds no value to the convo

If the conversation is clearly over, especially after an agent sends a closer or if the customer sends a final message like “OK” or the notes say to give the last word.






        Repeated Non-issue questions

If a customer asks the same question more than twice and it’s not related to an issue, concern, product, or escalation, you can close the conversation after answering it twice.

Closing Conversations

So now that we know how to close a conversation, let’s talk about when to do it.
There are a few clear scenarios where it’s appropriate to close a conversation -  no response needed.
1. The message isn’t meant for us. Sometimes customers send a message that’s clearly a mistake — a grocery list, a random “I’m on my way,” or something typed by a toddler. If it doesn’t reference us, our product, or anything relevant, go ahead and close it.
2. Our reply adds no value. If the conversation has clearly wrapped - like after an agent sends a closer message like “No worries, have a great day and if you have any other questions, feel free to reach out” , and the customer responds with something like “OK” or “Thanks”, we don’t need to keep it open. You might also see notes that say “give the customer the last word.” That’s your cue to close it.
3. Repeated non-issue questions. If someone asks the same off-topic or non-actionable question more than twice - like asking for freebies we don’t offer - it’s okay to close after responding twice. We want to be helpful, but we also need to be efficient.








        Situations when a reply is unnecessary

Cases where a customer’s response doesn’t require assistance

Emoji or reaction responses




Opt in messages




Phone number or promo code texts without context & relevancy




Automated messages




Journey replies


When To Close
Closing Conversations
4. A reply is unnecessary. Sometimes, a response just isn’t necessary. Here’s what that can look like:
A customer sends just emojis, a thumbs-up, or a reaction message.
They send opt-in keywords or phrases  like “Y” 
You get an automated message like “Sent from my iPhone” or “I’m driving right now.”
They text us a coupon code or a phone number without any context or relevancy to the thread.
Or they’re replying to an Interactive Journey message with a choice like A, B, or C. In these Journey cases, we don’t respond -  just close it with some exceptions you’ll learn later on in your training. 
The key takeaway: If the message doesn’t require help, action, or a follow-up - it’s safe to close.

Unsubscribing


Unsubscribing a customer is the act of removing a customer from the text message marketing list.
After unsubscribing, the customer will no longer receive any texts from us or the brand. 


What does it mean?

We’re legally required to get a customer’s permission before texting them - and to stop immediately if they ask us to without any follow up texts. Failing to follow these rules can lead to lawsuits, financial penalties, and damage to the company’s reputation.

Compliance
We should unsubscribe the customer as soon as we’re aware it’s needed, without sending any additional messages beforehand.
What does it mean? Unsubscribing removes a customer from the brand’s text message marketing list. Once someone’s unsubscribed, they’ll no longer receive any texts from us — not promos, not follow-ups, nothing.
Why is this important? Because it’s a matter of compliance. Texting laws require us to have clear permission to message someone — and more importantly, we must immediately stop if they ask us to.
No confirmations. No “are you sure?” No extra messages at all.
Failing to follow these rules isn’t just a bad look — it can lead to lawsuits, hefty fines, and serious damage to the brand’s reputation.
Here’s the bottom line: As soon as we're aware that an unsubscribe is needed — whether a customer says it outright or it's clear from the context — we take action immediately. No replies, no delays, no additional messages.  Just unsubscribe and move on to the next conversation. 


We unsubscribe by clicking the drop down button, then selecting “Close and unsubscribe contact” or we can use the shortcut Shift + D

How to unsubscribe

Once a customer unsubscribes, they’ll automatically receive a confirmation message letting them know they’ve been removed from the list. No further follow-up is needed, and they will be taken out of the queue.
If the customer wishes to resubscribe, they have to follow the opt-in steps again. 

What Next? 
Unsubscribing
So, how do you actually unsubscribe someone?
It’s simple. Click the dropdown button at the top of the conversation. Then select “Close and unsubscribe contact.”
Or, you can press Shift + D to do it even faster.
What happens next? 
Once a customer is unsubscribed, the system will automatically send them a confirmation message letting them know they’ve been removed from the list.
You don’t need to follow up or explain anything further — they’re also automatically removed from your queue.
If they ever change their mind and want to resubscribe, they’ll need to go through the opt-in process again from their side.
So remember: One click, no replies, and we’re done.









        The customer is younger than 13

If the customer explicitly states that they are under the age of 13 (we should not probe for the customer’s age)

        The customer asks to be unsubscribed

If the customer let’s us know they no longer wish to receive texts (even with conditional statements)

Unsubscribing
When To Unsubscribe
Now let’s get into the specific situations where we should unsubscribe a customer.
1. The customer is under 13 years old. If a customer explicitly tells us they’re under 13, we unsubscribe them immediately. We do not ask follow-up questions, probe for their age, or try to confirm — if they say it, that’s enough, if not, we help them as usual.
2. The customer asks to be unsubscribed. If someone says they don’t want to receive texts anymore — even if it’s worded casually or with conditions — we unsubscribe right away. Statements like:
“I don’t want these messages,”
“Stop texting me,”
Or even “Please remove me unless you give me an update on my order” all count.



Sometimes, the customer won’t explicitly say we should unsubscribe them but will indicate that they wish to be removed from the list or shouldn't be subscribed. 
So we need to look out for these indicators (key words and phrases) and immediately unsubscribe them

STOP
UNSUBSCRIBE
OPT OUT
REMOVE
CANCEL
REVOKE
QUIT
Examples
Key words
⛔️
🛑
✋
🖕
Emojis
Leave me alone
Shut up
Fuck you
Wrong number
Delete my number/info
No need to send another message
I’m blocking you
Phrases
STOO
Unsbscribe
Opt Ot
Rmv
Cncl
Revke
Qwit
Key word Typos/Variations
 If a customer says we should remove them from the email list then we can give them instructions. But if they say both email and text list - we just unsubscribe.
Unsubscribing
When To Unsubscribe
Sometimes, a customer won’t say the exact words, “Please unsubscribe me,” but they’ll clearly indicate that they want to be removed — or that they shouldn’t be on our list at all.
That’s why it’s important to pay attention to signals, not just keywords.
Let’s break that down:
Key words and phrases to watch for include:
Stop
Unsubscribe
Opt out
Remove
Cancel
Revoke
Quit
Even typos and variations count, like:
Stoo, Unsbscribe, Opt ot, rmv, cncl, rvke, or qwit
We also look out for emojis that strongly signal a desire to stop communication — things like: ⛔️ 🛑 ✋ 🖕
And then there are phrases that, while not direct commands, make the customer’s intent clear:
“Leave me alone”
“Shut up”
“F*** you”
“Wrong number”
“Delete my number” or “Delete my info”
“No need to send another message”
“I’m blocking you”
Keep in mind - these are just examples, not an exhaustive list. So while keywords, phrases and emojis help, we should also use our best judgment.
If a customer’s tone or message clearly shows they no longer want to hear from us, we treat it the same way — and unsubscribe them right away.
Here’s one more thing to keep in mind:
If a customer says they want to be removed from the email list, you can go ahead and give them instructions.
But  if they say both email and text — we unsubscribe them from texts without responding.
Because once they’ve mentioned texts, that falls under compliance. And our job is to act,  not reply.

Blocklisting

Blocklisting

Blocklisting refers to restricting a customer from sending any further messages to our number. This action is taken when a customer’s messages are offensive and directed at us as agents, as we have a zero-tolerance policy for abusive behavior.

What does it mean?

We blocklist by clicking the drop down button, then selecting “Close and blocklist contact” or we can use the shortcut Shift + B

How to blocklist






       The customer uses offensive language

If the customer uses profane, vulgar or derogatory language to express negative emotions targeted at us as agents or groups of people


1




       The customer sends inappropriate images

If the customer sends sexually explicit or suggestive pictures or media


2
Send ct temp before blocklisting
Blocklisting
When To Blocklist





Not all negative feedback warrants blocklisting. Frustrated customers may complain or give harsh feedback - that’s normal and should be met with empathy and support. 
Blocklisting is only appropriate when a customer uses offensive language that’s personally aimed at us as agents or generally offensive language towards a group of people.

Know The Difference!

Inappropriate language
Blocklisting
When To Blocklist
It’s important to know the difference between negative feedback and behavior that requires blocklisting.
Not every frustrated customer needs to be blocklisted. Sometimes, customers will express harsh feedback or complain  and that’s completely normal.
In these cases, we respond with empathy and support. Frustration happens, and our goal is to address concerns without escalating the situation.
Blocklisting is a last resort, reserved only for those who cross the line. It’s not about disagreeing with us or being upset - it’s about offensive language that’s personally aimed at us as agents, or language that’s generally offensive toward a group of people.
Remember, it’s always about respect. So, if a customer is expressing frustration without using offensive language or personal attacks, we listen, empathize, and offer support.







      The customer continuously spams us

If the customer sends us 10 or more irrelevant messages in a day or multiple ones over 2 separate days.

       The customer sends us scam images

If the customer sends us ads disguised as video game buttons or anything similar. Do not click on them!

No need to send the ct temp or send any message to the customer beforehand for these cases. We blocklist right away!
Blocklisting
When To Blocklist
There are a couple more situations where blocklisting is the right move:
3. The customer continuously spams us. If a customer sends at least 10 unrelated messages in a single day, things like shopping lists, random links, or messages clearly meant for someone else -  that’s spam, and we block.
If they send multiple unrelated messages on two separate days, we block them the next time it happens, even if the days aren’t consecutive. So, if they’ve spammed us twice before, and do it again on a third day - that’s your sign to block.
4. The customer sends scam images. If a customer sends us ads disguised as buttons or shady images, like fake “download” or “play” buttons - do not click them.
In both of these cases - spam or scam - there’s no need to send the inappropriate content template (ct) beforehand we should just block them right away.  We block spam messages to maintain a clean queue and ensure we’re prioritizing customers who genuinely need support.

Not every message needs a reply
If there’s no value in responding or it clearly wasn’t meant for us, just close the conversation.
Respect the signs
If a customer wants to unsubscribe, whether they say it directly or just hint at it, don’t wait. Just unsubscribe. No replies needed.
We do not tolerate abusive behavior
If a customer uses offensive language, targets you personally, or sends inappropriate content, we block. 
Continuous spam and scams = straight to blocklist
Whether it’s TikTok spam or shady scam images, protect yourself and the brand by blocklisting right away.
