What is Double Texting
Double Texting
How to Avoid It
When to Double Text

Double-texting means sending multiple messages in a row, where the information could have (and should have) been consolidated into one complete message.
Introduction
What is Double Texting
You forget to include something important
This often happens when:
You send a message before proofreading
You realize you made an error, like sharing incorrect info or leaving something out

When we double-text unnecessarily, it increases their costs. A message that could’ve been consolidated into one clear reply becomes two billable messages instead.
Cost to Client
SMS compliance laws exist to protect customers from spam. Sending unnecessary or frequent messages can push us toward violations, even if unintentional.
Compliance Issues
Nobody enjoys being flooded with fragmented responses. It makes us look unprepared and can make customers feel like they’re being talked at, not to.

Double Texting

Always reread both your draft message and the customer's message. Often, we miss key points that could’ve been included the first time. Fix it before hitting send.
Proofread
How to Avoid It
The best messages answer the customer fully without being wordy. Think of it like packaging; neat, thoughtful replies make the best impression.
Be Efficient
Don’t let urgency lead to sloppiness. Before double-texting, ask yourself: “Is this essential? Can I rephrase or wait to include this in a better way?”

While we aim to avoid double-texting in most situations, there are times when it’s necessary. What matters most is the intention, the context, and how you follow up. Here, we outline the rare cases where double-texting is okay and shows how to do it cleanly and professionally.
When Double Texting Is OK
When to Double Text
If your response has too many parts, it may be better to split it for clarity. But this should feel intentional, not like you forgot something.
When the message is info-heavy

When to Double Text
If you sent incorrect information (like a wrong price, broken link, or misleading wording), it’s your responsibility to correct it, clearly and promptly.
If you’ve made a meaningful error
This includes forgetting links, promo codes, or parts of the answer that affect the customer’s next step. These aren’t small omissions, they impact action.
When something essential is left out

When you have to send a second message, always connect it to the first. The second text should explain why you're following up and clarify what was missing or wrong.
How to Double Text the Right Way
When to Double Text
“Just to clarify something I missed in the last message…”
Use Callback Phrases
“Sorry! I left out the most important part. Here it is.”
“Quick follow-up to correct what I just shared.”
This makes the second message feel responsible, professional, and helpful, not like a mistake or an interruption.
Note that we’ll be monitoring message frequency. If we notice repeated or deliberate double-texting, we’ll follow up with you directly!
