When not to sell
Customer Satisfaction Comes First
Prioritize resolving the customer's primary issue or concern before introducing sales opportunities.

Respect Boundaries
Recognize when a customer is not receptive to sales suggestions or is frustrated and avoid pressuring them. We should always maintain a positive customer experience

Focus on Value
If a sales opportunity doesn't genuinely benefit the customer, refrain from pushing it and instead focus on delivering exceptional support.

Show Sensitivity
If a customer is sad or has shared bad personal news, avoid pushing sales and instead focus on providing empathy and support. 

You should always use your own judgement and imagine yourself in the customer's position.
