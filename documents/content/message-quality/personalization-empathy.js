We act as representatives for our brands; therefore, it’s essential to provide customers with accurate information, while also delivering a personalized experience.
A personalized experience goes above and beyond meeting clients' demands; it also gives customers another reason to choose our clients and their products. A good customer interaction will make or break a lifelong relationship with the brand.
We should avoid sounding like a bot, and instead maintain a conversational tone based on the brand’s tone preference. Our empathy and enthusiasm to help and empathy should resonate with them, so our customers feel like they’re (1) talking to a real person, and (2) their problem or inquiry is being addressed.
It's easier to make clients feel like you're focused on them and their concerns as a person when you humanize the dialogue. When it comes to delighting customers, compassion and optimism count for a lot.
How to Personalize Responses and Deliver Empathy


1. Treat our conversations like talking to a friend or family member
	(keeping in mind the brand’s tone preferences in case they prefer formal) Don't skip the niceties or miss an opportunity to turn even the toughest of conversations into positive interactions. Mirror their tone (upbeat for excitement, calm/reassuring for frustration)
	2. Focus on our customers’ unique needs
	Pay attention to their message, catch context clues (from the UI, their wording), and use that information to resolve the customer’s issue or to answer their inquiry. This requires active reading: truly understanding before responding
	3. Recognize the customer’s emotions and respond accordingly
	We don’t want to communicate with our customers in the wrong context - if they’re upset, be apologetic, when they need help, offer it eagerly, and if they’re happy, mirror their enthusiasm
	4. Empathy first, understanding second, solution third
	We must deliver empathy in all the conversations we handle - whether they need help, have trouble finding a product, or simply ask a question, customers will feel our sincerity through messages. Lead with empathy before diving into details
	5. Be proactive
	Use all the tools available to us from the UI, the website, and Google for resolution - let’s take advantage of all the resources that we have to resolve issues as soon as we can (e.g. recommend products that fit the customer’s description if the exact item isn’t available, communicate with our customers with a proactive mindset so they don’t have to reach out to us multiple times unless they want to)
	6. Personalize Templates
	Templates are a great starting point, but always adapt them. Insert the customer's name (if available), reference their specific issue/product, and adjust the language to fit the conversation's context and tone. Don't send generic templates without review
	7. Acknowledge Your Actions
	When troubleshooting or looking something up, let the customer know. Simple phrases like "Thanks! I just checked the code on my end and..." show you're engaged and working on their request
	8. Acknowledge Previous Messages
	When picking up a conversation or if a previous message from another agent needs clarification (especially if a mistake was made or for continuity), acknowledge it. For example: "I'm sorry for any confusion with the previous information, I meant to say..." This helps maintain a cohesive, single-person feel
	9. Message Layout for Readability
	When composing your response, especially if it contains multiple pieces of information or is longer, break it down into short paragraphs or use line breaks (by clicking 'Enter', not 'Shift + Enter'). This makes the message much easier for the customer to read and digest on their screen, especially on mobile.
	

Showing Empathy - Key Actions
Integrate these actions consistently:
* Always show our eagerness to help
   * Use positive affirmations.
   * Let them know that we got their message.
* Say thanks whenever the subscriber provides information or does something that helps us resolve an issue, such as:
   *  Giving order details
   * Providing screenshots
   * Giving details regarding their inquiry
* Apologizing whenever the customer is going through a bad experience
* Sending whole sentences instead of one-word or one-liner replies 
* When a customer shares personal information, we can acknowledge it briefly and politely but don’t engage in a way that would cause the conversation to focus excessively on such personal information. Guide the conversation back to the main issue.
* Actively converse with customers when making a recommendation
Clarity and Conciseness in Communication
Clear communication builds trust and efficiency.
* Use Clear, Simple Language: 
   * Avoid jargon (internal terms like SKU, overly formal language like "pursuant to"). Use everyday words customers understand.
* Be Concise: 
   * Keep messages focused. For SMS, aim for short sentences and get straight to the point (Lead with solution/answer, provide necessary context, state next steps).
* Proofread:
   *  Always double-check for typos, grammatical errors (especially subject-verb agreement, commonly confused words), run-on sentences, and awkward phrasing before sending. Read your response aloud if unsure.
Handling Delays and Wait Times
Respecting the customer's time is crucial.
* Holding Message: We aim to get back to the customer once we have all the information, rather than sending filler texts. Holding messages are typically not used for standard look-up times. Use cases include:
   * The customer asks for an update on an existing escalation or an Ops Issue you or someone else posted. Example: "Thanks for checking in! I'm still waiting to hear back from the team on this, but I'll let you know as soon as I have an update."
   * The customer mentions they've already emailed support and are asking for an update via text. Example: "Thanks for letting me know you've emailed! Our team handles those inquiries in the order they are received. If you'd like me to see if I can assist here, I can certainly try."
* Apologize for Delays: An apology for a delay is warranted in these situations:
   * Timestamp Check: If you are sending the first agent response of the day to a customer and their initial message was sent over 20 minutes ago, acknowledge the delay. Example: "My apologies for the delay in getting back to you!..."
   * Multiple Pings: If a customer sends multiple follow-up messages (e.g., "hello?", "are you there?") before you've had a chance to respond to their initial query, acknowledge the delay. Example: "So sorry for the wait! I'm just getting to your message now..."
   * Escalation Updates: When providing an update after an escalation or a known internal delay. Example: "I apologize for the delay in getting this resolved. My team is looking into this and I’ll be in touch as soon as I hear back." or "Thank you so much for your continued patience while we work on this!"
Mirroring the Customer's Tone
Matching their style builds rapport quickly.
* Excitement: Use upbeat language, positive adjectives, maybe an exclamation point. "That's awesome news! I'm so glad you love the [product]!"
* Respectful/Formal: Maintain a polished tone, full sentences, and proper greetings. "Good afternoon. Thank you for reaching out. I would be happy to assist with cancelling your order."
* Frustration: Use calm, validating language. Directly acknowledge their feelings before troubleshooting. "I completely understand how frustrating repeated delays must be. Let me look into this immediately."
Non-Apology Statements (What to Avoid)
Non-apologies sound like apologies but shift blame or invalidate feelings, eroding trust.
Why They Don't Work: They imply the problem is the customer's reaction, not the issue itself. They show a lack of ownership and can make customers feel dismissed.
Examples to AVOID


"I’m sorry you feel that way."
	"Sorry if that caused you any trouble."
	"My apologies if this caused trouble."
	"Sorry if you were offended."
	(Blames feelings)
	(Suggests trouble might not exist)
	(Conditional)
	(Focuses on reaction, conditional)
	Instead, Use Genuine Apologies: Own the issue directly


"I understand how upsetting this has been for you."
	"I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience you’ve experienced."
	"I’m sorry our message/the situation caused frustration."
	"I apologize for the mistake/delay."
	General Best Practices & Tips
* Use Customer's Name: If available, use their name early in the reply to personalize.
* Personalize Templates: Always adapt templates. Remove irrelevant info, add specifics, and match the tone.
* Proofread Everything: Typos and grammar errors undermine professionalism and clarity. Use tools like Grammarly or simply re-read.
* Read Aloud: Reading your response aloud helps catch awkward phrasing or missed errors.
* Know Brand Tone: Adhere to specific client guidelines regarding formality and tone.
* Avoid Dismissive Language: Don't use conversation-enders like "Hope this helps!" mid-troubleshooting. Keep the dialogue open until resolution. Use clarifying questions instead ("Can you send me a screenshot of the error?").
* Continuous Learning: Pay attention to feedback and common errors to improve clarity and empathy over time.
* Using AI Tools Appropriately for Personalization:
* AI can be a helpful tool for generating initial drafts or suggesting rephrasing, but it should NEVER replace genuine human empathy and critical thinking.
* Always review and heavily edit any AI-generated text to ensure it:
   * Accurately reflects the customer's specific situation and concerns.
   * Maintains the correct brand tone and your personal, empathetic voice.
   * Is free of generic phrasing that sounds robotic.
   * Directly addresses all parts of the customer's inquiry.
