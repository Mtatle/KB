Good morning everyone! I would like to ask you to turn on your cameras for this and following trainings. If you’re unable to turn it on just dm me via Slack to let me know. Just a heads up that these trainings are meant to be interactive so don’t hesitate to jump in with any questions you might have; either turn on mic on or drop them in the chat, for the parts where we will be going through messages together if no one comes forward I will be calling people out. Before we start, I’d like to get to know you guys a little bit so please share a hobby that you enjoy in the chat. I’ll share some of mine as well

These are the topics which we’ll go over today. The first thing we’re going to talk about is what led us to change the old QA framework and why we decided to revamp the old one. Second we’re going to go over the new methodology, third, is the reason for this session and we’re going to deep dive into the new QA score, we’ll start with a high level view of the category buckets, then we’ll move on to the categories and subcategories. Next, we’re going to go over the category explanation and we’re going to go over some examples. I’d like to see your understanding of everything that we’re going to talk about and I’ll have you guys answer some simple questions, yes/no and you can jump in to share the reasoning behind your answer. Lastly for the live scoring, it’s a sneak peek into Part 2 activities

 Objectives
The first point you see, is to: Align our vision of high quality, sales focused conversations for enhanced client satisfaction. We went back to the basics to see what a high quality message is, and what does it mean to us and to other stakeholders that are involved. One is the merchant or the brand and second it’s the customer we’re supporting. A high quality message can for the merchant means that we shared accurate information, we made a sale or an attempt at it and made the customer happy. 

For the subscriber it means that we personalized their experience, resolved their issue, even if it’s not resolved we get to a point in the middle and we did not waste their time. We wanted to take all of this and align it with the QA framework with the vision was to have high-quality, sales-focused conversations that will enhance the customer satisfaction. 

We wanted to simplify the categories. We noticed that with the previous framework a lot of the categories were overlapping and in a way leaking into each other and it was almost as not following one meant that others will automatically not be followed so we wanted to combine those categories and mesh them together.By doing that we wanted to achieve for the scoring to be objective eliminating any possible interpretations of one line item that can vary from auditor to auditor. So simplifying the categories would lead us to an objective scoring. And that makes it much more simpler for you guys to understand and receive correct evaluations.

Each week 12 conversations will be audited per agent. 
After 8 weeks, auditing will become proportional to your number of messages sent.

  Methodology  
There will be a nesting period after training concludes to ramp up to the process. 
The official pass rate will be determined and shared in the coming weeks. 

You will have 24/7 access to the auditing doc which will be shared once you have passed training.






Audits will be on a message level with a requirement for backreading.

We will also monitor Productivity, AST, Escalation Rate and Availability
Specific targets for these KPIs will be shared at a later date. 

You will have the opportunity to dispute scores that you do not agree with.

  Introduction to QA Scorecard
This is the outline of the new QA framework. This is a very high level of the framework ~ moving forward we will have 3 main category buckets: Resolution and Selling, Accuracy and Workflow and Tone and Empathy. All of these words are not new to us, except for the selling part, to make it easier to understand it’s a form of drive to purchase but it’s not limited to only the scenarios that we have outlined there. So there are 3 main category buckets and you’ll notice that there are no numeric scores. So when we talked about objectivity, you either pass or fail resolution and selling, or pass or fail accuracy and workflow or pass or fail tone and empathy, even the conversation as a whole you either pass or fail. You’ll notice that there is no weightage so neither one is the most important but they are all equally important.

How do we know if a conversation is passed or failed as a whole? Passing is the equivalent of a Yes across all categories, again not one category is more important than the other. Going back to our objective that we want only high quality messages being sent out and we will adjust other things to make sure we’re sending out high quality messages. Which is why to pass a conversation we need to pass all categories. A fail means that you’re missing one category, so failing one category fails the entire conversation.

Let us look at the categories for each category bucket as well. A lot of this might be familiar to you because it’s picked up from the old scorecard. On the left hand side you have the category buckets and on the right hand side you have the categories. Categories for Resolution and Selling are issue identification (did we identify the customers intent), proper resolution (did we troubleshoot, did we use all resources before esc, did we answer all customer questions)  and product sales, this is kind of new but it’s similar to drive to purchase. Product sales lets you have the autonomy to identify an opportunity to upsell or provide a recommendation, this provides you with more freedom that isn’t limited to the D2P scenarios we had where you might recognize an opportunity outside of those and utilize it 

Categories for Accuracy and Workflow are accuracy (was the information shared accurate and from a credible source) so for ex if you want to upsell and share a link, what accuracy does is capture if that link is from a credible source. The second is workflow (did we follow internal workflows or if we’re following the merchant’s workflow). Workflow includes all the resources that we have, you look at the notes, templates, customer information etc. 

Categories for Tone and Empathy are clarity (was the message clear, understandable and was correct grammar used) and tone ( is the message personalized, empathetic and did we follow the correct tone outlined in the UI)  

Additional flags are Opt out and Inappropriate language, this is still consistent with what we had previously compliance. If you receive a markdown in any of these, the conversation will be failed automatically.

The next thing we’re going to discuss is the core concepts or objectives that we want to achieve with each category. When we think about resolution and selling we should always strive for issue resolution. Us striving for issue resolution is slightly different than just giving the customer information. There can be points when the customer reaches out and the customer is looking for something we don’t offer and it’s not possible, telling that it’s not possible is just giving them information. Striving for resolution is you understand what the customer wants, you inform them that it can’t be done but since you understand the question you might offer an alternative resolution that meets them halfway. The second is to capitalize on sales opportunities - we have a dedicated session specifically for this. 

For accuracy and workflow, we should always provide accurate information, use only approved resources, we don’t want to use third party resources, and follow merchant and internal processes. The only time internal processes are different is if the merchant wants us to follow a different process and this will be indicated in the notes

For tone and empathy, we should ensure there is a conversational flow, that we come off as a unified front, the customer shouldn’t feel like they’re texting with several people. We should always be empathetic, previously we were sending empathy statement, empathy added score means that you feel what the customer feels and you’re able to convey that. We don’t want to send only empathy statements to come off as empathetic we also want to show it on how we’re handling the conversation. Sometimes we can have and we have seen this in conversations, where we’ve sent an empathy statement but the whole response sounds off or cold. It’s really important that we immerse ourselves into the experience and try to help them and navigate them the same way we would want to be navigated if we were in the same situation. We should use the merchants preferred tone outlined in the UI

If anyone of these are unchecked, that means you failed that line item.
We're going to deep dive into the QA scoring framework now. Going back to the fact where we talked about wanting to score more objectively this is what will help us. We have the category buckets and the categories and under those are subcategories. The purpose of having these subcategories is so that if this frequently occurring scenario happens, and if an auditor comes into any of these they’ll know into which category bucket they have to place it. This is to eliminate different interpretations of the line items and another reason for this is to help us track any trends. If something is not going well under any of the categories we will know what exactly we need to target. The subcategories will be in checkboxes, if the checkbox is marked then it means that the line item was accomplished. 

Issue Identification: 
Identify the intent: understand the subscriber’s message intent and what they needed from us. If the intent wasn’t understood by the 
Unnecessary reply: you did not avoid replying when the subscriber’s message did not justify a response

Proper resolution:
Efficient Troubleshooting: the most effective way to solve the issue without wasting the customers time and asked probing questions when the subscriber’s text was clear
Correct Escalation: you did not follow company guidelines around escalations and escalated conversations that could have been solved
Double Text: you did not send answers in one text
Partial Reply: you did not answer to all questions the customer had

Product sales:
Restock: you did not send a sales link when the subscriber asked about product restock dates 
Discount: you did not send a sales link when the subscriber asked for a promo code and we don't have one to share
Upsell: you did not send a sales link when the subscriber had intent to purchase or purchased
General recommendation: you did not send a sales link regarding general topics

Accuracy: 
Credible Source: using information from sources that are verifiable and related to the merchant
Promotions: use a discount code that is valid, it’s in the UI or it is approved by the merchant. Hallucinated part applies to AI as we’ll be using this card to evaluate AI messages as well 
Links: correct links, from a correct website, to the correct product, sending filtered links 

Workflow:
Attentive UI: you did not backread the conversation, you did not use resources available under the company or subscriber profile, note, promo notes and templates 
Website: you did not use the website to find the answer, you did not use information from the product page, or went to the checkout page to verify information

Clarity:
Correct grammar: clear grammar 
No typos: no typos
No repetition: no repeated phrases or templates throughout the conversation
Understandable: you shared information in a way that is clea to the customer

Tone:
Preferred tone: use the tone outlined by the merchant in the UI
Personalization: edit your responses and templates to suit each unique subscriber
Empathetic: empathize with the customer in situations where it was needed

Did we identify the issue and strive for issue resolution?
YES
What we did well here: We didn’t just provide information but also provided a resolution or workaround.
We strived to provide the best possible resolution, in a scenario where we are not able to offer the customer exactly what they asked for.

Did we identify the issue and strive for issue resolution?
NO
The customer can already check the status of their order, which is how they discovered it hasn't shipped yet. They're inquiring about the delay in shipping.






This may look like a correct response initially. However, it’s important to note that the customer is already aware that their order has not shipped. This indicates that they have access to the status of their order.
Sending them the page where they can check the status, in this scenario, is not helpful. The customer’s concern is around the delay in shipping. Also notice, that they placed the order on the 9th of March and they reached out to us on the 20th of March.

Did we identify the issue and strive for issue resolution?
NO
Item shared in the message
This can also be mistaken for accuracy. While that's not entirely incorrect, it's crucial to emphasize that our main challenge was not identifying the correct path to a resolution. There's an opportunity to investigate further here. We lacked information about the jacket the customer mentioned. Even if we had sent a jacket instead of boots, it would still be considered an inefficient step toward resolution, as our approach appears to be trial and error. And it's crucial to always avoid making assumptions.

Did we identify the issue and strive for issue resolution?
NO
The message received is not related to the brand we are supporting.

We successfully recommended items matching the customer's stated preferences.
Did we capitalize on sales opportunities?
YES
Item shared in the message
Ask them if there's an opportunity to send a link, and if so, was it utilized?

The customer had an intent to purchase but was unable to find anything in their size.  Since we can't provide a recommendation link without knowing their size, the message will be marked as “N/A” for the category and evaluated based on the most suitable response.
Did we capitalize on sales opportunities?
N/A
Ask them if there's an opportunity to send a link, and if so, was it utilized?

We're currently unable to send a link as we're still gathering all the necessary information.

The customer made a purchase, creating an opportunity for us to upsell.
Did we capitalize on sales opportunities?
NO
Ask them if there's an opportunity to send a link, and if so, was it utilized?
