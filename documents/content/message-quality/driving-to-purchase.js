Driving customers to purchase is one of the most essential responsibilities of a Concierge agent. While resolving customer issues is crucial, our overarching goal is to consistently contribute to revenue growth. Every non-negative interaction is an opportunity to guide the customer toward a purchase by offering them the most relevant, timely, and personalized product experience possible.


Build product value
	Provide confidence
	Upsell
	Simplify the buying process
	By clearly communicating features, benefits, and how an item meets the customer's needs.
	In product decisions by validating items, sharing reviews, and visual comparisons.
	When the customer shows an intent to purchase.
	By proactively providing links to products, collections, or pre-built carts.
	  

	  

	  

	  

	Importance of Sharing Links


We’ve learned that the best way to drive customers to purchase (in addition to giving them an excellent experience) is to make purchasing as easy as possible.


Messages that include links are 150% more likely to lead to a purchase than messages that do not.
	Links make it easy for the customer to take the next step. Whether it’s browsing, purchasing, or resolving an issue.
When Not to Send Links
Do not send purchase links in the following situations, unless the link directly helps resolve the customer's issue:
* The customer has an unresolved concern, pending escalation, or an open case with Customer Support that hasn't been resolved.
* The customer is clearly frustrated or upset.
* The customer explicitly states they are not interested in making a purchase.
* The customer shares personal news that is sensitive or distressing.
In these cases, prioritize empathy, support, and issue resolution over sales. Focus on building trust and addressing the customer's needs before considering any product recommendations.
When to Send Links: Key Scenarios


In all other situations where sending a link is appropriate, and the conversation naturally allows for it, we should take the opportunity to share a product link to encourage the customer to purchase.


Important: Always verify that a product is in stock before sending the link.


There are 7 main opportunities where we need to send out product recommendation links to our customers:


1. Customer is Just Browsing


Prompt: Customer says they’re "just browsing", “thanks”, “I don’t have any questions”, etc. They have no specific questions, concerns, and show no interest in a specific item.


Action: Recommend a product or collection using the nw/np template.


  



2. Product Out of Stock


Prompt: Customer asks about a sold-out or unavailable product.


Action: Send the appropriate template and offer a similar in-stock alternative.


  





3. Order Upsell Opportunity


Prompt: Customer lets us know they have made a purchase, demonstrates interest in our brand, products, or expresses any intent to purchase, whether immediate or in the future.


Action: Suggest a complementary item or something that might interest them.


  



4. Customer Asks for a Recommendation


Prompt: Customer directly asks us to suggest a product.


Action: Share a specific product link that aligns with the customer’s needs, and build value by explaining how and why this option is the most beneficial choice for them.


  



5. Providing the Customer a Discount


Prompt: When providing the customer with a discount code or similar offer.


Action: Redirect the customer to a specific product page or collection so they can make use of the discount.


Note: If the customer is frustrated or the issue hasn’t been resolved, we should not send a recommendation alongside the code unless it’s part of the resolution. 


  



6. Customer Is Looking for Specific Products


Prompt: Whenever a customer mentions they’re searching for a specific product, such as “I’m looking for the Blue Denim, Corleto dress”.


Action: Look up the item on the website to confirm availability and share the direct link to the product page with the customer.


  



7. Customer Is Looking Generally for Products


Prompt: If a customer says they’re looking for items within a general category on the brand’s website, such as “I’m looking for a T-shirt”, or provides limited details that don’t clearly indicate a specific product, like “I’m looking for a blue T-shirt”.


Action: Use The Funnel Method


What is The Funnel Method? 


The Funnel Method is an approach designed to guide customers toward the right products and eventually the product they will purchase when they haven’t provided much detail. 


1. Start Broad – Share the General Product Category Page
If a customer mentions interest in a general category on the brand’s website (e.g., “LG TVs”), begin by sending them the main product category page.
Example:
 “Here’s a link to our full range of LG TVs: https://www.lg.com/us/tvs”

Ask Targeted Follow-Up Questions
In the same message, ask clarifying questions to understand their preferences. These questions should cover key features or specs that influence product choice.
 For example:
   * “Do you have a preferred screen size?
   * “Any specific price range you’re aiming for?”
   * “Do you have a color or design preference?”

   2. Use Their Responses to Filter Options
Once the customer provides more details, go back to the general category page and use the site’s filters (e.g., size, resolution, price) to find the most relevant options.

Provide Refined Recommendations
Share a filtered category link with results that align with their requirements. You can also offer brief descriptions or highlight features to make the choices easier to compare.


Non-compliance Example: 


In this example, we fell short by not linking to the White Dresses collection, which would have better aligned with the Funnel Method strategy.


  



We should always include a link to the products the customer is asking about and not just ask follow-up questions. This gives them the chance to browse on their own if they prefer, while keeping the conversation helpful and solution-focused.


Compliance Example:


Here's a clearer and more effective way to approach this message, shown in the example below.


  





How to Probe When the Product Reference Is Unclear


If a customer is inquiring about a product but doesn’t provide enough detail for us to confidently identify it, we need to validate which item they’re referring to before proceeding with a resolution.


That said, product validation should only be done when the information provided is insufficient for us to reasonably determine the item on our own.
Before reaching out to the customer, check the following sources:
   * The customer’s browsing history (if available)
   * Any automated texts or product links previously sent
   * The brand’s website
   * A quick Google search if needed
This can often help narrow down or even identify the product without needing to ask the customer.
   1. If Unclear After Research
   * If multiple products match the description or there’s still ambiguity:
   * Share the appropriate product page links and politely ask the customer to confirm which item they’re referring to.
   2. If Further Clarification Is Needed
   * When the exact product is essential to resolving the issue and still cannot be determined:
   * Ask the customer to provide the SKU or model number.
   * Alternatively, request a screenshot of the product so we can locate it on our end.


  







Tool: Recommended Links


Under the Customer Profile, there are recommended product links based on customers' past purchases or the brand’s best sellers (if users haven’t purchased).


  



By clicking on the speech bubble icon, we are able to insert the links easily into our response. We always have to double-check if the product is in-stock by going directly to the link.


  

Tool: Customer Profile Features


   * Browsing History
These are all the products the customer has looked at since they joined our SMS list.


   * Last Checkout
This is the link to the last cart they created with us.


   * Purchased
Here are links to all the products the customer has bought, along with the dates they made each purchase.


   * Order History
This section shows all the purchases the customer has made. If you click on the order number, it will take you to the order confirmation page. In this example, this is the link to that confirmation page.


We can easily insert any of these links by clicking on the speech bubble icon   




Tool: Pre-Built Checkout Links 


What are Pre-Built Checkout Links?
Checkout links are cart links that include specific items we have added, which customers can click to purchase instantly. To create an accurate checkout link, we’ll need to know exactly which items and any applicable coupons the customer intends to use.


When Are They Used?
Pre-built checkout links are used when customers:
   * Ask to purchase through you
   * Express clear buying intent for a specific product/s (e.g., “I’m going to buy this”)
   * Struggle to add items to a cart
   * The customer cannot use the code, but we’re able to apply it on our end


  



Important: We will only share pre-built checkout links for Shopify brands, and only in-stock items are selectable. For non-Shopify brands, pre-built checkout links will not work. In these cases, we can guide customers by providing clear written instructions along with screenshots to show them exactly what to do. 


For examples on how to use screenshots, refer to our Messages with Helpful Links guide.




How Do We Use Them?
To send a pre-built checkout Link, we need to create it first, including all of the items the customer wishes to purchase. A simple way to do this is through the Concierge UI directly. 








  1. To start the process, click the CART button under Company Profile.
  



2. Search and add the product (select size/color/etc).  




















3. Apply discounts (if any).
  



4. Insert and send the checkout link.
                  


You can also build a cart manually through the brand’s website. Simply create the cart yourself, including all of the intended products, discounts, or other requirements. Then copy the checkout link and send it to the customer. Always ensure that the link matches the correct region based on the customer's location.
All pre-built checkout links that we are allowed to manually send will resemble the example shown below:
  



When to Use Pre-Built Checkout Links vs. Product Links
   * If the customer has clearly indicated they’re ready to purchase, use a Checkout Link to streamline the process.
   * If the customer is still browsing or exploring options, send Product Links to give them more flexibility.


Tips & Tricks 


   * Share products that are available in all sizes to avoid stock issues.
   * Click the link yourself to confirm it opens correctly and leads to the intended page. Exclude characters like “-”, “.”, etc, at the end of links.
   * For global brands, make sure you're linking to the correct country/language version based on the customer’s location.
   * When recommending a product, aim to choose one that genuinely resonates with the customer, this not only streamlines their purchasing decision but also helps you more effectively demonstrate its value.
