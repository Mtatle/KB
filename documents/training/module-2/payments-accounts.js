Payment Methods

Overview
Other Methods
Gift Cards
Credit & Debit Cards
Types of Payment Methods
 Commonly used and require accurate billing details. Most brands accept major card networks like Visa or Mastercard
Gift cards are brand issued cards that are loaded with a specific amount of money
 Services like PayPal, Apple Pay, or Google Pay. Speeds up checkout and adds extra security, if available
 Includes store credits, or local payment options. Availability varies by brand, and some may have usage limits
Customers can pay for their orders in a variety of ways, from credit and debit cards to digital wallets. While many brands support these methods, not every brand offers them all. It’s important to know which methods are accepted, any restrictions they might have, and how to guide customers through each option
Digital Wallets
Prepaid cards are general payment cards loaded with a set amount of money, used to purchase until the balance runs out
Prepaid Cards

Credit and debit cards are the most common payment methods. They’re issued by banks and require accurate billing details, including a valid address and security code (CVV), to complete a transaction
Customers should always double-check the billing address, one typo can block a payment
Tip 
Widely accepted across most brands
Billing address and CVV verification are essential
May be declined due to insufficient funds, expired cards, or security flags
Key Takeaways
Credit & Debit Cards

Gift cards are cards loaded with a set amount of money, used as a form of payment. They are issued by the brand and can only be used at specific stores, or a group of stores
If a customer wants to purchase a gift card online, they won’t be able to apply any discounts
Tip 
The balance should be checked before purchase
Online Gift Cards are usually sent to an email address after purchase
They may not stack with other discount codes or promotions
Key Takeaways
Gift Cards

Preloaded with a set amount of funds. While they work similarly to regular cards, some issuers or brands may restrict their use. Popular examples are Visa or Mastercard prepaid cards
  Don’t escalate prepaid card issues — the brand doesn’t provide the cards and can’t resolve the issue
Tip 
Purchases can only be made up to the available amount
Most prepaid cards can't be reloaded
If a prepaid card is declined, it’s often due to limited balance, or it’s not accepted at the store
Key Takeaways
Prepaid Cards

Digital Wallets
Services like PayPal, Apple Pay, or Google Pay store payment details for faster, more secure checkouts. Not all sites accept these wallets, so confirm availability if a customer asks
If it’s not an issue on the customer’s end, it’s usually a website glitch, have them try a different browser and clear cache
Tip 
Some sites may not accept digital wallets
If the Digital Wallet system is down, it's not something we can resolve
Apple Pay only appears on Apple devices, so customers on Windows won’t see it even if it’s available
Key Takeaways

Other Methods
Includes store credits, local payment services, or even cash on delivery. Usage rules vary widely; for example store credits typically apply automatically at checkout
Research and troubleshoot first, if the customer still has issues then we can escalate
Tip 
Store credits may expire or have limits
Cash on Delivery isn't charged until the order is received, however it’s an outdated method
Always check what payment methods are supported
Key Takeaways

Payment Issues

Overview
Payment issues are problems that can occur during checkout or after a purchase. They include problems like a declined card, duplicate charges, or a payment not showing up. 
We review the details, ask clear questions, and explain the steps to fix the issue. This helps us solve problems quickly and keeps our customers satisfied
Common Scenarios
Declined Cards
Prepaid Cards
Paypal Issues
Pending Charge

Declined Cards
Use the mtch template first

Verifying the billing address and zip code match the card details
Testing a different browser if needed
If these steps don’t resolve the issue

Escalate or direct the customer to CS based on the provided notes
When the issuing bank or payment processor rejects a transaction. Common causes include mismatched billing details (like zip code), insufficient funds, or suspected fraud
How to Handle a Declined Card

2

Declined Cards
For Shopify brands, if the shipping address is different from the billing address, it may cause issues because Shopify automatically sets them as the same
If We Suspect This is The Case
Ask the customer if their shipping and billing addresses match
1
If not, tell them to uncheck the "Use Shipping Address as Billing Address" option
2

Prepaid Cards
Inform the customer that their prepaid card isn’t accepted
Suggest using a credit card or an alternative payment method
Sometimes customers attempt to use prepaid cards at checkout. While some prepaid cards work, others may be rejected due to restrictions or compatibility issues with our payment system
How to Handle a Prepaid Card Issue
Apologize and send the pcr template

Only Paypal Available
Explain they can still use a card even if PayPal is the only option shown
By choosing Paypal at checkout, paying with a card through the service, however without logging in
Sometimes customers only see PayPal as the payment option, but they want to pay directly with a credit or debit card instead
How to Help When Only Paypal is Available
We send the ppl template

Pending Charge
If there’s no email confirmation, the order likely did not go through
The pending charge will usually revert within 24–48 hours, or process successfully 
Sometimes a customer reaches out because they see a pending charge on their payment method, but haven’t received an email confirmation from the brand. They’re unsure whether the order was successfully placed
How to Help When There’s a Pending Charge
Use the cp template

Two Different Cards
Bonus!
Explain split payments aren’t supported, however the workaround being buy a online gift card
Using the gift card at checkout + paying the rest with the second card
Customers sometimes want to use two different cards at the same time to pay for a single order, but the checkout process doesn't support that directly
How to Help a Customer Use Multiple Cards
We guide them using the dcc template
If the brand doesn’t offer online gift cards we would educate the customer about the limitation and thank them for their feedback

Financing in the US

What is Financing
Financing in the United States refers to the process of borrowing or raising money to fund various purposes such as purchasing a home, a car, education, or funding a business
However, we will be focusing on financing when it comes to using it to place online purchases
Financing 101

The Financing Process
The financing provider reviews the customer’s information and credit score to decide if they qualify. High credit scores usually mean better financing terms 
Approval Process
If approved, the customer receives clear loan details:
Interest rate: How much they'll pay extra
Loan amount: How much they can borrow
Repayment: When and how frequently they will pay the loan back
Financing Terms
After the customer accepts the terms, the funds become available either immediately (one lump sum) or as a credit line
Funds provided
The customer fills out an application providing basic personal and financial information 
Application 
+$
The customer makes regular payments including the original amount plus interest. Paying on time helps their credit score; late payments negatively affect it
Repayment
-$

After that the customer simply adds their card
Some services use the chosen card to process the application on the spot, but for others they may need to input personal details as well

Troubleshooting Financing

General Troubleshooting
For general troubleshooting, if you can’t find the answer in our templates, the best thing to do is check the official website or FAQ page of the financing provider. They usually have detailed and reliable information to help answer customer questions
Quickly scan the internet for key info
Read carefully to understand clearly
Keep this info handy for future reference!
Encounter a new financing method or inquiry?

Financing and Credit Score
Here's how to clearly explain the answer to the customer question
Use the fcc temp
Whether their credit score will be affected, depends on the financing option they choose. For example, some options like Afterpay, typically don’t affect credit scores
Will my Credit Score be affected?
However, since financing companies may still report payment information to credit bureaus, we don't guarantee this. Instead, we recommend customers check directly with the financing company for accurate details

Financing Approval 
Financing decisions are made exclusively by the financing partner, not the brand, so the Customer Support team doesn't have access to detailed reasons for denial
Here's how to clearly and politely explain the situation
Use the fnn temp
I wasn’t approved for financing :(
We need to help customers understand we don't control financing approvals and direct them to the financing provider

Issues with Shop Pay
Shop Pay is a checkout and payment service offered by Shopify. They offer payment in installments (Buy Now, Pay Later) and come with many perks as it’s integrated with their system
If a customer doesn’t want use Shop Pay or can’t use other financing options because of it
Use the xsp temp
What is Shop Pay?
However, some customers who purchase through Shopify don’t want to use Shop Pay, which can lead to issues
Create a mock cart to verify all options show for guest checkout

Accounts

Customer Accounts
Customers want to update a subscription tied to their account
Subscription Changes
Customer assumes they’ve created an account because they placed an order
Account Confusion
A customer is unable to access their account tied to the brand
Common Account Issues
Inability to Log in
A customer account stores personal details, order history, and payment information. Ensuring smooth access to accounts enhances customer satisfaction

Inability to Log in
The “Inability to Log in” refers to situations where users are unable to access their accounts, either through the web, mobile app, or other interfaces
Typo in username or password

Technical Issues

Inability to Log In
When a customer reports they’re unable to log in, we follow a structured process to quickly identify and resolve the root cause. After checking notes and templates as they always come first, here's how we typically troubleshoot:
1
2
Ask for a screenshot & description of the error
Advise a password reset
Suggest a different browser or device
This helps us see exactly what they see, which often reveals the nature of the issue
If no specific error is shown, and we see an “Incorrect email or password” error, ask the customer to use the “Forgot Password” option, and try alternative emails if they have any, alongside reminding them to check their spam or promo folders for the reset email
If issue persists, suggest switching to incognito mode, or trying another device
If all else fails, we can escalate or send to CS per notes

Account Confusion
If a customer is unable to log in, often they may assume they’ve created an account because they placed an order
≠
Common Account Issue
But if they checked out as a guest, no account was actually created
Key Points
Placing an order does not automatically create an account
1
Customers must manually create an account 
2
Attempting to log in without doing so will show a "No account found" or similar error
3

Subscription Changes
Subscription changes are a common type of account-related issues
Update the items in their subscription
Skip a delivery
Change frequency
Cancel or pause the subscription
Subscriptions are typically tied to a customer’s email/account, even though they may appear as orders in the UI
These changes usually involve customers wanting to

Subscription Changes
When found, share the link or instructions with the customer
We have templates for many brands covering common subscription requests
If a template for subscription changes exists, use it
If there are no templates, check the brand’s Help Center or FAQ for documentation on managing subscriptions
Customers can often manage their own subscriptions by logging into their account. If possible, we want to direct them to log in and make changes directly
1
2

Subscription Changes
If no information is available, and the customer cannot make changes themselves
No need to ask for the order number
Only ask for the customer’s email address as that is what the subscription is tied to
Escalate the issue or send the customer to customer support (CS), based of the notes

Name Changes
     That isn’t my real name  >:(
When customers receive journeys using this name, if it’s wrong they often contact us saying:
Why Do Customers Reach Out?
In the Agent UI, we often display a customer’s name tied to their phone number  
However, the name typically captured during sign-up for SMS may not always be accurate
Bonus!

Name Changes
How We Resolve Name Change Requests

If we’re supposed to escalate, check if a phone number is available in the UI. If not, ask for the customer’s phone number, and if they didn’t already provide a name ask them to confirm their real name

Empathize With the Customer
Apologize for the mix-up, address their concern and:
Empathize With the Customer
Escalate

Refer to the brand’s notes to determine whether the issue should be sent to CS
If that is the case, simply forward the customer to CS and they will handle the request
Send to CS
Escalate the issue to the team and add the phone number, and real name in the escalation notes


Best Practice

✔ Refer customers to FAQs, templates or information to assist in account issues where applicable. Aim to be helpful and supportive in addressing account issues
✔ Use clear and simple language for guidance
✔ Be empathetic for the customer’s frustration
✔ Verify customer’s identity before making account-related changes that require escalation
✔ Offer alternative solutions when troubleshooting
