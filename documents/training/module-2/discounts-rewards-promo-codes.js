   Discounts 101



Automated messages in the UI
Email subscriptions and newsletters
Brand’s website or app
Brand’s social media accounts





Discounts are reductions in the price of goods or services. They can be offered in various forms and are often used to incentivize purchases


Example 
Common Discount Locations
Definition
Discounts, rewards, and promo codes are powerful tools to attract and retain customers. They make customers feel valued and encourage repeat purchases

Types of Discounts
 By clearly explaining these offers, you can ensure customers make the most of their savings while fostering positive brand engagement
The commonly available discounts are:
Different discounts offer different value and brands offer them depending on their sales approach
First-Time Buyer Discounts
Seasonal Discounts
Flat Amount Discounts
Free Shipping Discounts
Loyalty Program Discounts
Buy One Get One (BOGO)
Types of disc - first time buyer Winback code, promos - seasonal discount code be a code or items already discounted on the website - up to 30% phrasing -differentiate those small differences in the UI

Types of Discounts
Discounts offered to new customers to encourage their first purchase
Example: “As a first-time buyer, you’re eligible for a 10% discount. Use the code WELCOME10 at checkout.”
First-Time Buyer Discounts
The cost of shipping is waived for the customer
Example: “Enjoy free shipping on orders over $50 with the code FREESHIP.”
Free Shipping Discounts
A fixed amount is deducted from the total purchase
Example: “You’ll get $10 off your purchase with this code.”
Flat Amount Discounts
When customers purchase one product, they receive an additional product free or at a discounted price
Example: “Buy one shirt and get the second one at 50% off with the code BOGO50.”
Buy One, Get One (BOGO)
Discounts offered to members of a loyalty program as a reward for their continued patronage
Example: “As a loyalty member, you’re eligible for exclusive discounts. Use the code LOYALTY15 for 15% off.”
Loyalty Program Discounts
Discounts offered during specific seasons or holidays
Example: “Get 20% off all winter coats with the code WINTER20.”
Seasonal Discounts

Unique Cases
Discounts can be interpreted differently by the customer. It's important to understand the UI's nuances and be prepared to clarify them when necessary
Winback Discounts
Seasonal Discounts
Up to X%
A discount code targeted at re-engaging previous customers who haven’t made a purchase in a while. This is still a promo code, but specifically targets customers who were previously browsing without buying. Winback offers are typically higher than regular promotions to better incentivize customers to return
These can be applied in two ways:
Using a discount code that customers must enter at checkout or an automatic discount where items are already marked down on the website
“Up to X%" means that the maximum discount available on select items is X%, but not all products may be discounted at that rate. For example, if a promotion states "Up to 30% off," some items may be discounted at 30%, while others may have smaller discounts (e.g. 10% or 20%)

Navigating Discounts

How to Find a Discount
Concierge Offer
Promo Stamps/Notes
Previous Automated Messages
Brand Website
When assisting a customer with discount codes, we have multiple ways to locate them. The process depends on where the code was originally shared or stored
The key locations where discount codes can be found are:

Concierge Offer
Offer Available
Offer Unavailable
The Concierge Offer is a key section that contains a customer-specific code that is meant to be shared with the customer in case they reach out asking for one
Since these codes are validated before being added as the Concierge Offer, they are usually active. However, if a code is visible to us (e.g. "WELCOME10"), always double-check its validity
Where we immediately glance

Concierge Offer
The AW Template is a pre-formatted response that automatically fills in the promo code for easy sharing
The {coupon} statement pulls the active Concierge Offer code into the message
This is useful if the AW Template doesn’t work, because we can manually use {coupon} to share the code
What is the AW Template?
This is the most time efficient way to send codes to customers
{Coupon} Placeholder:
We can create a Text Blaze Template for this to save time

Promo Stamps
Not all codes in this section are available for every customer. If a promotion is restricted, this will be clearly stated in the Promo Stamp. Always check for any special conditions before sharing
These codes are mostly active and pre-validated, but we always double-check to be on the safe side
Promo codes are often stored in our Promo Stamps. We naturally review these at the start of an interaction, making them among the first places to check
The obvious place to check!

Notes
Sometimes, a direct code may appear in the Notes if there are issues with an existing promotion. In these cases, an alternative code might be provided in the Notes as a backup solution for the customer
So in most cases, Notes won’t contain the actual code, but will instead provide explanations to help us better understand and respond to customer inquiries
Codes are typically stored in Promo Stamps, not directly in the Notes, as Promo Stamps are designed specifically for storing and managing active promo codes
Can we find codes in the Notes?

Previous Journeys
If a customer was given a promo code during a previous interaction, we can find it in their Previous Journeys
So always make sure to Backread!
Important to not overlook!
How to search Previous Journeys:
Press ctrl + f Type a keyword to find the code faster:
  Coupon Name (e.g., "WELCOME10")
  Discount Amount (e.g., "10", "15")
Scan the highlighted results to locate the  promo code and the journey
Often, journeys will include code expiration dates or special conditions, so checking the journey can provide extra details
If the journey message itself does not include terms, clicking the link where the coupon was applied may reveal more details

Website
Many brands display current site-wide promotions at the top of the webpage

Website Header
Many websites offer a signup discount for new customers who subscribe to their email & SMS list

Bottom of the Website
Some websites use a "Spin the Wheel" feature where customers enter their email to receive a code. The code is then usually sent to their email address or phone number with which they signed up

Spin the Wheel

Website
Bonus!
Use the URL Trick, search for Promotions, or Offers
If the page exists, it should be among the top search results
Many brands have a Promotions Page listing all current discounts. This page is useful for:
Checking active promotions
Finding extra details to resolve customer issues
Brand Promotions Page
How to find it?

When to Check Validity?
 If the promo is outside of Notes, Promo Stamps, or the Concierge Offer make sure to check it’s validity 
 If the customer wants to use the code on specific items, and we know exclusions may apply, we need to verify it
Whenever sharing a code always communicate any terms and conditions clearly if they apply
IMPORTANT
Since we cannot share an invalid promo code, it is crucial to confirm that a code is still active and applicable before sending it to a customer

General Customer Questions

Special Discounts
There are special discounts offered to certain groups as a way of showing appreciation for their service
Military Personnel – Active duty, veterans, and sometimes their families
First Responders – Police, firefighters, EMTs
Healthcare Workers – Doctors, nurses, medical staff
Teachers – Educators at recognized institutions
The "ms" template
Do you offer any Military Discounts?
When a customer asks about these discounts, our standard approach is to send them

Applying a Promo Code
Our default response is to send the "db" template, customized to match the brand’s checkout process
How do I apply the code to my order?
For a Shopify brand, we will be able to apply promo codes at the checkout screen
Since we can send cart links for Shopify brands, if the customer is having issues applying the code we would:
1
Ask the customer which items they want to buy and which discount code they want to use (we can also ask for a screenshot)

2
Add those items to a shopping cart
3
Apply the discount code and share the cart link with the customer so they can check out easily


Applying a Promo Code
When making an online purchase, customers will typically go through two key screens:
If both screens exist some codes may only work when applied at checkout or vice versa, so if a code doesn’t work at the cart stage, try again at checkout
Shopping Cart Screen
Checkout Screen
This is the page where customers can see the items they’ve added, adjust quantities, and sometimes estimate shipping costs
On some websites, this page will also have a promo code field, allowing customers to apply a discount before moving to checkout
This is where customers finalize their purchase by entering shipping information, selecting a payment method, and applying any promo codes (if applicable)
Many brands only allow promo codes to be applied at this stage rather than during the shopping cart step
Example: For Fashion Nova, some codes may not work if entered at the shopping cart stage but will at checkout

Discount Requests
If a customer asks for a general discount or expresses concerns about affordability (e.g., "I can't afford this" or "Is there any discount available?"), we send them any valid promo code
This helps create goodwill and encourages the sale while respecting our guidelines
 When to offer a discount code
 If a customer requests a general discount
If a customer is looking for a specific amount
For example “I want 30% off”, “can we do $50 on this”. However such a promotion does not exist
We can provide a code that is equal to or better than what they are looking for
If we can’t find a matching code:
We offer any alternative code, but clarify that it may not be the same as the one they originally requested

Discount Requests
If no alternative promotions exist, we omit the last sentence of the "ncode" template
What to do if no discounts are available?

1
Send the “ncode” template
2
Provide an alternative promotion if possible:
A link to the brand’s sales collection
Information about free shipping offers
Any other available incentives

Discount Requests
If a customer is inquiring about a discount for a specific product and we don’t have one, make sure to:
Check the product page. Is the item already discounted? If yes, then encourage the sale by emphasizing its value
 "This item is already discounted, so I’d recommend you go for it since you’re still getting it at the best price and with exceptional value!"
What to do if no discounts are available?


Discount Requests
 If a customer asks about a specific discount that the brand already offered, we do not automatically send them a different promo code. Instead, we troubleshoot to make sure they can apply the correct discount properly
When to avoid simply offering a promo code
 At the same time, we can see if we have another code that is equal to or better than the one they requested. But we do this alongside troubleshooting

Ops Issues
The customer was told they'd receive a discount code but never got one, and no code is currently available
They reported not receiving their welcome code
The brand persona name is missing
An automated message sent contains an error
The Concierge Offer shown in the UI is invalid
When do we deal with Ops Issues?
We might be dealing with an Ops Issue!

Ops Issues
Check if the opt-in message mentions a discount
Look at the bottom of the website, and check if a welcome offer is available
If the customer can provide proof (e.g. a screenshot of the sign-up confirmation), proceed to check for the code
Follow our workflow for finding discount codes
If none found, search in the #concierge-ops-issues channel to see if a code is available
Verify if they’re supposed to receive a welcome code
1
Find the welcome code
2
If no code is available, post in the #concierge-ops-issues channel including a: Brand Name, Conversation Link, and Short description of the issue
3
Important: We cannot share unique codes assigned to one subscriber with another, only general codes
Customer is asking for their welcome code

Ops Issues
Create a mock cart and try applying the code
Check the coupon inspector (if available)
Verify if the items are eligible for the promotion
Check if they have used It before
1
Troubleshooting steps
2
If the code is not valid on our end and the items qualify: Post in the #concierge-ops-issues channel
3
Customer welcome code isn’t working
Has the customer already used the code on a previous order?
2.      Yes?        Educate them that it’s been used on          a previous order   
3.      No?        Troubleshoot:

Ops Issues
Check for expiration dates – If the code is expired, educate the customer
Check if it came from a third-party website – If yes, inform the customer that we cannot verify codes from external sources
Check the code’s validity
1
Find an alternative code
2
If the code is not valid, but was shared in an automated message: Post in the #concierge-ops-issues channel
3
The code we shared isn’t working
If the code should be active, but isn’t working:
Look for a Concierge Code with the same discount and share that instead
If no alternative code is available:
Search in #concierge-ops-issues to see if there’s an updated code

Troubleshooting

Troubleshooting
Code & Source
When a discount code isn’t working, our troubleshooting process helps pinpoint the issue quickly. First, we confirm basics like code validity, expiration date, and eligibility. If the problem persists, we dive deeper—checking cart items, possible system glitches, or brand-specific rules—so we can guide the customer to a solution
How to Troubleshoot
?
The “ABC” Framework
Initial Troubleshooting
Availability & Expiration
Validity Check
Basket Conditions
Brand-specific troubleshooting instructions, found in the Notes and Brand-specific Templates, should always be followed before the general troubleshooting. These take priority in all cases!
IMPORTANT
Customer Eligibility

Code & Source
Before diving into any troubleshooting, it's essential to confirm the exact promo code and its source—especially if it’s not clearly stated by the customer

?
If the customer vaguely says something like: “The discount isn’t working”
But doesn’t mention the specific code or where they saw it, and we can’t determine it from the conversation
Politely ask for more info, using or adapting the disk template
The customer clearly provides the code in their message
1
The code is obvious based on context (e.g., replying to a marketing message that includes the code)
2
When You Can Proceed
When You Need to Ask First

Validity Check

Apply the code and observe whether it works and what error appears
Avoid sale items, bundles, subscriptions, or gift cards unless the promo allows
Choose items that should meet the general promotion terms
A validity check is a quick review to see if the code should work. Creating a mock cart is the first and most important troubleshooting step. It sets the foundation for all further analysis
?
Common Steps
Validity Check

Validity Check
If the brand uses Shopify (green bag icon), always run the code through Coupon Inspector

?
This tool only works for Shopify brands!
Tells you instantly if the code is valid, expired, or has restrictions
1
May show exact terms: expiration, applies to which products/categories, minimum spend, etc.
2
Faster than creating a cart in many cases (but still use a mock cart to confirm functionality)
3

You’ll see the coupon inspector if it’s a Shopify brand
How to use the Coupon Inspector
?
Locate the Inspector
See the code details and inform the customer accordingly
Check Code Details
A blank result doesn’t mean invalid, we continue troubleshooting
Continue Troubleshooting
Validity Check

The ABCs 

Availability & Expiration
If it’s invalid, let the customer know. It also shows when exactly the code expired if it's inactive by clicking the "i" icon
Most promo codes have a specific validity period, that is why we always confirm if the code is still active
Expiration Date
?
Coupon Inspector (if available)
Check the code message and look for expiration date
Backread
If we didn’t send the code, check the website for promotions and see if it’s there
Validate Source

Basket Conditions
If the customer provides a cart screenshot, check if any items are excluded by the code’s terms
Some discount codes exclude certain products, such as bundles, subscriptions, or sale items. So we verify the cart against any restrictions 
Eligible Items
?
Review Screenshot/Message
Look up the code’s eligibility rules in the coupon inspector, notes, or the brand’s website terms
Check Code Restrictions
If an item is ineligible, let the customer know and suggest other alternatives or a different discount code if possible
Confirm No Conflicts

Check if there’s a required order total. If the cart doesn’t meet this amount, the code won’t apply
Some discount codes require a minimum purchase amount or only apply to specific collections
Terms of Use
?
Minimum Threshold
See if the code is limited to certain product lines or categories
Collection Restriction
If the customer’s cart doesn’t meet the terms, let them know or suggest an alternative code if available
Next Steps
Basket Conditions

Check if it’s a welcome code or a single-use offer restricted to new customers
Some promo codes are limited to first-time buyers or one-time use. Make sure the customer’s situation meets these conditions before applying the code
Usage Restrictions
?
Verify Code Type
Confirm whether the customer has used this code before
Check Order History (if available)
Customer Eligibility

Customer Eligibility
Watch for signs that a customer may have resubscribed, these are often noticeable in the welcome journey message
Usage Restrictions
?
If the journey message includes phrases like “Welcome back” or “You’re already subscribed,” it’s a strong indication that the customer is resubscribing
“You are already subscribed”
If the customer openly mentions that they’re resubscribing, it’s safe to assume that they are
Customer says they’ve signed up before

Resolution
If you’ve tested the code and it works with the correct conditions, but the customer says it’s not applying:
?


Let the customer know the code works, but has specific conditions (e.g. full-priced items only). Share any key exclusions and findings about the code you’ve observed
Politely confirm your findings:


Ask them to re-enter the code, making sure items meet the criteria and there are no typos or formatting issues
Suggest they try again:

Additional Troubleshooting

Customer Still Reports Issues
If the customer is still experiencing issues after you've provided clear guidance and they've tried again, it's time to gather more details
?
What to Do
What to Say
Kindly request a screenshot of their cart. This helps you see exactly what they’re experiencing and identify any issues that might not be obvious from their message
Thanks for giving that another try. If the code still isn’t working, could you please send a screenshot of your cart? It should show the items, the code entered, and any error message you’re seeing. That’ll help us better understand what’s happening on your side.
You can also use or adapt DER/DET templates 

Additional Troubleshooting
The items in the customer’s cart are ineligible due to exclusions or site-specific restrictions.
Once a screenshot is received, take a moment to review it carefully. Look for any obvious issues:
Ineligible items
A straightforward issue caused by a typo in the promo code
Misspelled codes
The items in their cart are already discounted or have a coupon applied (double-check, as it may be allowed)
Already discounted items
Once you’ve identified the issue, gently explain it to the customer in a clear and friendly way. For example:
“Ah, I see! It looks like this item is already on sale, which is likely why the code isn’t applying.”

Additional Troubleshooting
Offer to create a cart link with the correct items and discount pre-applied
For Shopify brands, if you're confident the code works but the customer is still struggling:
Shopify Brands – Offer a Cart Link
?
This eliminates manual entry errors and improves conversion

Additional Troubleshooting
If we’ve tried all troubleshooting steps and the code still won’t work. Gather details from the customer, then escalate or send to CS
?
Escalate 
Once you have the necessary info, follow brand-specific escalation guidelines
Send to CS
In case the issue should be sent to CS per the notes, continue to forward to Customer Support

Error Messages

Error Messages
Discount code isn’t valid for the items in your cart
Coupon code error messages are warnings that pop up when something is wrong with the coupon we’re trying to use while shopping. They tell us why the coupon isn’t working so we can quickly resolve the issue
?
Common Examples
Enter a valid discount code or gift card
Code isn’t available for you at this time
Discount code has reached user limit

Error Messages
Check the screenshot or re-enter the code correctly
If you receive the message "Enter a valid discount code or gift card," it may be due to one of the following reasons and can be resolved by:
Mistyped the code
Confirm if the code is active by using a mock cart and the coupon inspector
Code does not exist
Ensure they’re on the correct brand’s site (e.g. check brand-specific cww temp)
Customer is on the wrong website

Error Messages
Crosscheck if items are excluded or ensure any required items (e.g. free gifts or BOGO items) are added
If the message "Discount code isn’t valid for the items in your cart" appears
Items in the cart are excluded
Crosscheck if items are discounted in the promo section and on the product page
Items are already discounted
Verify if the order’s subtotal without tax meets the minimum requirement
Minimum threshold is not met

Error Messages
Check order history to see if the code has already been used
If you see the message "Code isn’t available for you at this time",
 it could be for one of these reasons
One-time use code
Check order history to see if the customer has made a previous purchase
First-purchase only
Look in #concierge-ops-issues to verify if the code is assigned to a specific customer
Customer-specific unique code

Error Messages
Check the promo section, coupon inspector, or auto messages for more information about the code's limits
The error "Discount code has reached user limit", might be caused by
Limited redemptions

Retroactive Requests

What are Retroactive Requests?
Price Matching
A Retroactive Request is made when a customer would like to receive credit back after they have already made a purchase
The customer pays full price first, and the discount is applied later, usually when specific conditions are met. The types of Retroactive Discounts we will mention are:
Price Adjustments
Retroactive Discounts

Retroactive Discount Codes
 Check Notes in the agent UI
Check If it’s allowed 
Check if the customer is eligible
Sometimes, customers make a purchase then realize that they either forgot to apply a promo code or want to swap it for a different one
When this happens, we follow a specific process to handle their request properly. First steps to take are:
 Look in Templates – Use CTRL + F and search for “retroactive”
Check their previous orders to see if they’ve already used the same code or a different code with the same or higher value
Check the order they want to apply the code to, and test if the code is applicable by creating a mock cart

Retroactive Discount Codes
Once we have validated that it’s possible to apply the code we can:
Use the “rdr” template to:
Adding a code retroactively is not the same as editing an order, merchants can refund the difference without modifying the order. Do not use the “CED” template for these cases
If there are any brand-specific requirements in the templates or notes we must follow them!
Keep in mind
Always check if the customer sent in any details and edit the template accordingly!
Collect the order details
Get the promo code details
Escalate the request for approval

Price Matching & Adjustments
🛒 Price Matching
A customer wants to match a competitor’s price before making a purchase
💰 Price Adjustments
 Customers may notice a price drop after purchasing a product or find competitor offering a lower price. This often leads to questions about whether they can get a refund or an adjustment
To handle these inquiries effectively, it’s important to understand the difference between:
?
Before the customer buys the product
A customer has already made a purchase and wants a refund or credit for the price difference due to a later drop in price
After the customer has purchased the product

Price Matching Workflow
If you find a Brand Specific “Price Matching” template, feel free to send using the PMC shortcut 
Check the notes and templates for any details on Price Matching

Reward Programs

Reward Programs
Reward Programs allow brands to thank and retain loyal customers by awarding points or credits for various actions—like making purchases, referring friends, or celebrating milestones. These points can be redeemed for discounts, freebies, or exclusive perks, enriching the customer’s overall experience and fostering stronger brand loyalty
?
How Customers Earn Rewards
Special VIP tiers
Referral programs
Points for purchases
Birthday/anniversary rewards

Reward Programs
Reward programs typically come in two forms: Reward Points and Store Credit. Reward Points are earned through purchases or activities like leaving reviews, while Store Credit is often issued for returns not eligible for refunds or as compensation for inconveniences. Both aim to enhance customer loyalty, but each follows its own rules for earning and redeeming
?
Customers collect points for various actions (purchases, social media engagement, reviews) and redeem them for discounts or perks. Points usually appear in the customer’s account, and redemption often generates a unique code
Customers receive store credit in situations like returning a non-refundable item or as a goodwill gesture for an issue. It’s typically used at checkout like a gift card and usually doesn’t have minimum purchase requirements

How Customers Redeem Rewards
Most common ways
Redeeming rewards usually involves logging into an account, selecting the desired reward (often converted into a discount code), and applying it at checkout. Some programs apply rewards automatically, while others require manual entry
Always check the FAQ on the website to provide accurate information!
?
Applying rewards to purchase
Converting points into discounts

Common Inquires
Even reward programs can encounter issues like missing points or codes that won’t apply. By confirming brand rules and verifying the customer’s details, we can quickly pinpoint the issue and maintain a smooth rewards experience
?
Most Common Questions
“How do I check my reward balance?”
?
“Why didn’t I receive my rewards for a purchase?“
?
“Can I use my rewards with other discounts or promo codes?”
?
“What happens if I return an item purchased with rewards?”
?

Troubleshooting Issues
How to Troubleshoot
Check any brand notes first to see if the issue or policy is already outlined
Look for a matching template to quickly address the customer’s reward concern
If there’s no info in the notes and templates, search the brand’s FAQ or website for more details
If it’s a unique situation or no info is available, gather key details and escalate accordingly
