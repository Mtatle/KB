Mastering Shipping

 The Shipping Process
Delivered
Package reaches the customer
Transit
Shipment moves via a Delivery Provider
Processing
Order is prepared and packed
Customer places an order
Order Placed
The shipping process involves multiple stages, from order placement to delivery. Each step is crucial for ensuring the package arrives safely, quickly, and cost-effectively

Order Placed
For a few brands, this stage may also include fraud checks, where automated systems verify the order and it could be denied
The Order Placed stage is the first and foundational step in the shipping process. It sets the entire process in motion
Customer browses online store
Selects products and adds to cart
Adds shipping and payment details
Customer places order
Payment processing begins

Order Processing
Once the payment is confirmed, the order is recorded in the seller’s order management system
 At this point:
The customer receives an order confirmation email (sometimes an SMS message as well), with an order ID, estimated delivery date, and payment confirmation
Order processing, if not stated otherwise, is considered to last 3 business days
1
The system assigns the order a unique order number for tracking
2
Inventory levels are automatically updated to prevent overselling
3
The order is flagged as "Processing" and sent to the fulfillment team

Order in Transit
Several major carriers handle package transportation, each offering different delivery speeds and pricing
United States Postal Service (USPS)
UPS (United Parcel Service)
FedEx 
DHL 
The transit stage of shipping refers to the movement of a package from the seller or warehouse to the recipient. It is often the longest stage when shipping
Shipping carriers calculate shipping rates based on several key factors, the shipping rates are not controlled by the brand, but some brands do offer a fixed shipping cost

Order Delivered
Before a package is officially marked as "delivered," it undergoes last-mile delivery from the local distribution hub to the recipient’s doorstep
The Order Delivered stage is the final and most anticipated part of the shipping process. It signifies the successful arrival of a package at the recipient’s address
The courier attempts to hand over the package to the recipient on the estimated date. If no one's available, they may retry, leave instructions for pickup, leave the package at the address or return to sender
Once the package is delivered, the carrier updates the status to “Delivered,” and the customer typically receives a delivery notification via email or SMS. All order movements will be listed in the tracking information

Order Delivered
This usually means the shipping label has been generated, but the package hasn’t yet been scanned by the carrier. If a customer asks, we send them our “lbl” to clarify what’s happening
Sometimes, the carrier might mark an order as delivered before it’s physically handed over to the customer. If a customer inquiries, we send them our “stl,” advising them to wait a short time, check with neighbors, or contact the carrier
Occasionally, there can be delays or inaccuracies in the tracking updates. Two common scenarios are
Label Created, But No Movement
“Delivered” Status Before Actual Delivery

Shipping Options
International Shipping
Standard Shipping
Alongside different shipping carriers, there are various types of shipping options, each designed for different needs based on speed, cost and distance
Expedited Shipping
Express/Overnight Shipping

Importance of Shipping
There are many types of shipping options available depending on cost, speed, and delivery needs. And shipping timelines can differ greatly depending on the brand, as each one has its own systems in place for processing and delivering orders
Why We Need to Understand Shipping
Having a good understanding of shipping will help us deal with Pre-Purchase shipping inquiries, and any Post-Purchase issues!

Standard Shipping
The delivery time for standard shipping depends on distance, carrier, and route efficiency
Delivery Time for Standard Shipping
What is Standard Shipping?
Standard Shipping is the most common and cost-effective shipping method used for domestic deliveries at a more approachable price
This shipping option is ideal for non-urgent deliveries
Deliveries on average are within 3-5 business days across the U.S, however this does not account for processing time and could vary depending on the brand
Standard shipping sometimes is called Ground shipping
Note

Expedited Shipping
Therefore, if an order is placed on a Friday, it will not arrive by Monday
It ensures that packages arrive sooner than normal shipping times, usually within 1-3 business days, but can still vary depending on the specific brand
Delivery Time for Expedited Shipping
What is Expedited Shipping?
Expedited shipping is a faster shipping method designed to reduce delivery times compared to standard ground shipping
However, it comes with a heftier price tag
Processing time is not counted as part of the expedited shipping timeframe

Express/Overnight Shipping
Unlike standard or expedited shipping, overnight shipping guarantees same-day or next-day delivery
Delivery Time for Express/Overnight
What is Express/Overnight Shipping?
Express/Overnight Shipping, also called Same-day or Next-day shipping is the fastest shipping method available, designed to deliver packages within 24 hours from the time they are shipped
This service is ideal for urgent, time-sensitive shipments, but is the most expensive
Most times, customers must place their orders before a specific cutoff time to qualify for same-day or next-day delivery
Another thing to note, if an order is placed on a Friday, it will not arrive by Monday

International Shipping
The delivery time for international shipping varies based on shipping method, distance, customs processing, and carrier efficiency
Delivery Time for International Shipping
What is International Shipping?
International shipping refers to the process of transporting goods across international borders from one country to another
Not all brands support this option, as they are mostly made for a US audience
In general deliveries take way longer than standard shipping and may even take over 20 days to arrive

Shipping Destinations
AFP/FPO Addresses
P.O. Boxes
Shipping carriers provide various delivery destinations, usually home addresses. However other shipping destination options do exist, though availability depends on the carrier and client. The most common ones are:

P.O. Boxes
Shipping to a P.O. Box typically follows the same timeframe as standard shipping
Delivery Times and Availability
What Are P.O. Boxes?
P.O. Boxes are secure mailboxes located at a post office and rented by individuals or businesses. They provide a consistent mailing address and added privacy, making them ideal for people who move frequently or want to separate their personal address from their shipping address
Express or expedited options are often unavailable for P.O. Box deliveries, and some brands do not ship to P.O. Boxes at all. Always check a brand’s shipping policy to confirm availability and potential restrictions

AFP/FPO Addresses
Some brands do not ship to APO/FPO addresses or may have limited shipping options. Always check the brand’s policy for availability and any extra requirements
Delivery times to APO/FPO addresses can be longer than standard U.S. deliveries, depending on the destination’s location and military mail routing
Delivery Times and Availability
What Are AFP/FPO Addresses?
APO (Army Post Office) and FPO (Fleet Post Office) addresses are used by the U.S. military to deliver mail and packages to service members stationed overseas or on naval ships. They function similarly to domestic U.S. addresses but come with certain shipping restrictions

Pre-Purchase Shipping

The Shipping Template
To streamline the process of assisting customers with their shipping-related questions, it’s essential to understand the mandatory “Shipping time” template
The template that holds everything together
The shipping template includes key details such as
Even if the shipping template isn't directly used to respond to customer inquiries, its information serves as a guide to ensure that we can provide accurate information
Order Processing Time (if available): The time it takes for the brand to verify and prepare an order before shipment. 
Order Delivery Time: The estimated time for the carrier to deliver the order to the customer

The Shipping Template
For brands that don't specify processing times in the shipping template, you can refer to the shipping FAQs or use a default response, like the npt template
Once the carrier receives the order, based on factors such as the shipping method, destination, etc. they provide the customer with an estimated delivery date
This date is an approximation and not guaranteed
Order Processing Time
Order Delivery Time
We do not guarantee the estimated delivery date because orders may still be delayed by unforeseen circumstances, such as carrier issues or weather disruptions

Guaranteed Delivery Date
If a customer asks about receiving an item by a certain day, we should avoid making promises and instead use words like “should” while referring to the estimated shipping timeframe
This helps set the right expectations while providing accurate information
I want it delivered on March 9th
When dealing with these situations we can use templates like grn and tf to answer the customer
We should never guarantee an exact delivery date unless the brand specifically offers a delivery date selection option

Order Before Certain Date
When a customer asks if their order can arrive before a specific date, it’s important to offer the best available shipping option while not making any promises
Can it be delivered by May 6th?
Check the shipping template to see if standard shipping and processing meets the customer’s requested deadline
If no option meets their deadline, provide the fastest available shipping and its estimated arrival while apologizing for the inconvenience
How to handle this situation
If it does not, look for expedited options that offer on-time delivery. If one is available, share the details, including any extra costs and processing times
Use the cns template to let them know you’d love to serve them in the future when more time allows for timely delivery

Faster Shipping
Review the brand’s available shipping methods to see if any expedited options exist
If the brand does not offer expedited shipping, use the exs and cns template to politely inform the customer
When a customer asks if we offer faster shipping it's important to quickly assess and present the best available options
How to handle this situation
If expedited shipping is available, provide the details, including delivery timelines, any additional costs, and processing times
Can it be delivered by tomorrow?

 Shipping Too Expensive
Make sure to always personalize templates before sending them!
Note
When a customer expresses that shipping is too expensive, similar to discount requests our goal is to explore any possible ways to reduce their cost while maintaining a positive interaction
Check if any discount codes or promotions are available or if the brand offers free shipping over a certain threshold
If no discounts or free shipping options are available, or the customer still feels that the shipping price is unfair then we share the ste template
$50 is too much for shipping

Free Shipping
Otherwise it informs them that this option is not currently available
When a customer asks about free shipping, we provide them with the fs template, which informs them about the brand's shipping policy
If free shipping is available, it would state how much they have to order to get free shipping

Free Shipping
A common issue is customers not meeting the free shipping threshold, which applies to the subtotal before taxes and fees
Mistakenly count post-tax amounts
Lose free shipping when a discount drops their subtotal below the threshold
Customers can
To begin troubleshooting a Free Shipping issue, we start by gathering and sharing all relevant information regarding the customer's issue, which can be found both in the UI and on the website
We also ask the customer to provide a screenshot of their cart, in case additional details are needed to help resolve their concern
Process

Free Shipping
if they’re below the threshold, we can suggest a small add-on to qualify
if a discount affects eligibility, we explain why and offer solutions using sbt or sbtw template
Process

Post-Purchase Shipping

Overview 
Confirmed Order
Unconfirmed Order
In Transit
When handling post-purchase issues, it’s crucial to follow a structured approach based on the shipping timeline and the available order information. Order placement, processing, and transit present different scenarios, each requiring a specific resolution path
Order Is Placed
Processing

Order Is Placed

Handling Placed Orders
We need to troubleshoot to determine whether the order was successfully placed
For non-Shopify brands, we check the purchase history to see if the order appears
For Shopify brands, we check theorder details section
When a customer reaches out to confirm whether their order has been placed, our first step is to check the UI to determine if the order is confirmed or unconfirmed
How to verify an Order
If the order is not found in the UI
If the order is available it is confirmed, and we inform the customer of the order status and address any concerns. And we always double check the dates
If the order is visible under “purchased,” we inform the customer that an order is placed on this specific dateAlso, always double check the dates
This indicates we cannot find a completed transaction linked to the customer’s information

Unconfirmed Orders

Unconfirmed Orders



If a customer provides us with the Confirmation Email then we can safely conclude that their order is out of the 
Order Placed stage and is Confirmed!
If we don’t see any record of the order in the UI, we ask the customer to check for either of the two key indicators of a successful order
📧 A confirmation email
💲 A charge on their account
We also ask the customer when they placed their order to help with further troubleshooting
Note:
We use the COC template to guide the customer
Emphatise asking to chekc spam and promo 

Unconfirmed Orders
Customer has a pending charge but no confirmation email
1
This indicates the order may not have gone through yet!
We would empathize and use the CP template to explain

Unconfirmed Orders
Customer has a completed charge but no confirmation email
2
This suggests the order should have been processed, but it is still unconfirmed in the system
In this case, we escalate or send the issue to CS following the notes

Unconfirmed Orders
Customer has no charge and no confirmation email
3
This means the order did not go through at all, and the customer will need to place the order again

BONUS
Unconfirmed Orders
Some brands have both an online store and physical locations (or other sales channels). If a customer insists they placed an order but it’s not visible in the UI, it may have been placed elsewhere
Confirm whether the customer purchased through the brand’s official website or at a physical store/other channel
Always check any available notes or templates and follow them in these cases

Confirmed Orders

Confirmed Orders
This helps determine whether the order is still within the expected timeframe or if it is delayed
For confirmed orders, knowing the exact date of placement is essential
If the order is delayed and the brand is not fulfilling their shipping policy, we will need to forward the issue to the brand’s team

Confirmed Orders
If unavailable, ask the customer when they placed their order using wmo template
Look at the order details for shopify brands
For non shopify brands check the purchase history
To check the order placement time

Processing Stage

Handling Inquiries
Check 
Order Date
When a customer asks why their order hasn’t shipped yet, our first step is to verify its status in the order details or any tracking information available either from our system or provided by the customer
If we see it’s in the Processing Stage
Check 
Processing Time
Calculate
Respond

Order at an Unclear Stage
If the shipping template does not specify processing time
We check the brand’s FAQ or Help Center for further details

When Processing Time is Not Listed
If no information is available, we assume a default processing time of up to 3 business days before considering it delayed

How do we respond?
If the order is within the processing time
If the order is past the processing time and hasn't shipped
We reassure the customer that everything is on track. And provide them with the shipping template explaining the timeframe
We escalate the issue or refer the customer to CS based on the brand’s notes
Handling Inquiries

Order in Transit

Handling Inquiries
When a customer asks about the status of their order while it is in transit, we first check the order details for tracking information

The order details page or the tracking information may explicitly state that the order is in transit

If no tracking information is available, we estimate the order's status based on when it was placed and compare it to the brand’s shipping timeline

Order Delivery Status
The number of days since the order was placed
To determine if the order is still within the expected delivery timeframe, we compare:
The maximum processing time + maximum delivery time stated in the brand’s shipping policy
Processing and delivery times are usually given in business days, which exclude weekends. To count them accurately, use an online business day calculator
The order's on its way, but now comes the crucial part. Let's make sure it's actually arriving on time
