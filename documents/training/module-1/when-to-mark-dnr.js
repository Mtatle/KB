When To Blocklist

What is Blocklisting?
Why is it Important?
Helps maintain a safe and respectful environment. We do not tolerate unwanted or inappropriate behavior, and blocking ensures that individuals who engage in such conduct can no longer reach out to us
Respectful Environment
Blocking protects us from potential threats like spam, and malware scams, safeguarding both our team and our systems from harmful activities. Customers will however  be able to receive messages unless they choose to unsubscribe or block our number as well
Potential Threats 
Blocking a customer means they will no longer be able to contact Concierge. Any messages they send will not be placed in the queue for us to respond. Additionally, once a customer is blocked, we will no longer be able to send messages to them. However, this does not prevent them from receiving Attentive marketing messages

How to Blocklist?

Keyboard Shortcut

When to Blocklist?
When deciding whether to block a customer, the key factor is intent. We need to assess whether the customer's language is meant to express frustration about a situation or personally attack, degrade, harm us as customer support representative and just generally be vulgar
We’re not just blocking swear words, we’re blocking when they are used in a personal, or degrading manner. If they are using them in an non-negative way, with no malicious intent we can respond

What Behavior Warrants a Block?
A customer should be blocked if they send us a message that doesn’t align with our company interests. The types of behaviors we block are:
Inappropriate Behavior
Suspicious Behavior
Generally Offensive
Explicit
Abusive / Harassing
Scam Images
Spamming

Criteria for Blocklisting
When a customer personally attacks or harasses us through messages, their intent is to degrade, intimidate, or provoke a reaction
The customer is using slurs, hate speech, or taboo language in a way that is offensive to a group of people or society in general
Abusive / Harassing
Generally Offensive

Sexually explicit messages, images, videos, or suggestive comments, whether directed at you or in general
Explicit
Criteria for Blocklisting

Criteria for Blocklisting
Images sent by customers that are designed to look like a video play button, but are actually disguised scams or ads
Scam Images
    Don’t open or click on any unknown links or images the customer sends through

Criteria for Blocklisting
There are 2 types of spam message that we should block
Spamming
Customer spams/sends at least ten (10) unrelated messages in a single day
Customer sends multiple unrelated messages over three separate days
 
 
Unrelated messages include shopping lists, YouTube or TikTok videos, random words, messages meant for someone else, etc
If the message history shows unrelated messages on at least two different days, we should block on the third day this occurs again

When not to Blocklist?
A customer that is upset about an issue and uses strong language to vent frustration about their experience, expressing dissatisfaction with products or services should not be blocked
How to handle this?
 If we can help:
 If beyond our control:
Empathize: Acknowledge their frustration or concerns
Probe: Ask follow-up questions to better understand the issue
Resolve: Work towards a solution whenever possible

When To Unsubscribe

When To Unsubscribe
Why is it Important?
Privacy laws require businesses to honor opt-out requests immediately. Failing to comply can result in fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage. Proper handling protects the company from legal trouble and maintains compliance
Legal & Business Risks
Customer Respect
Customers have the right to control the messages they receive. Ignoring their request can lead to frustration, complaints, and loss of trust. Acting promptly ensures a positive experience and maintains brand integrity
Unsubscribing is the process of removing a customer from receiving any further messages (Attentive marketing messages & live agent), usually in response to their request. This is crucial for respecting customer preferences, complying with privacy laws, and avoiding potential legal issues. If a customer asks to unsubscribe, we must act immediately and without further engagement

How To Unsubscribe
Shift + D
Drop-Down Menu
Keyboard Shortcut

Why Immediately?
It’s Not a Choice, It’s the Law
Unsubscribing is not about engagement—it’s a legal requirement
One Mistake = Big Consequences
No Room for Judgment!
The System Handles It
Laws mandate instant action—not negotiation, not confirmation, just do it
Even one extra message after an opt-out can be a violation that leads to fines or lawsuits
Some customers actively look for violations to report or sue—don’t give them the chance
If an unsubscribe request comes in, the safest action is immediate processing, no second thoughts
Just trust the system—if they’re out, they’re out. Once unsubscribed, the customer is automatically removed from messages

Why No Confirmation?
Worst case? They escalate with complaints, bad reviews, or legal action
If they’re out, they’re out
No manual follow-ups
No response = No violation
More Messages = More Complaints
Customers opting out are already disengaged—any further message frustrates them
Replying is a Spam Risk
The System Handles It For You
If a customer says "Stop texting me" or similar, any response—even confirmation—can legally count as an unwanted message
The last message they get is the automated opt-out confirmation

Criteria for Unsubscribing
We must immediately unsubscribe a customer if their message meets certain criteria. We do not engage with the customer before unsubscribing them. Once unsubscribed, they receive an automatic confirmation message
Explicit Requests
Unsubscribe Keywords
Typos & Variations
Underage Customers
Special Cases

Criteria for Unsubscribing
Explicit Requests
Unsubscribe Keywords
Customers often state clearly that they want to stop receiving messages. If they say anything similar to the following, we must unsubscribe immediately:
Certain keywords automatically indicate a request to unsubscribe. If a customer sends any of these, they must be immediately unsubscribed:
Any STOP-related emojis

Criteria for Unsubscribing
Typos & Variations
Customers may make spelling errors when trying to unsubscribe. If the intent is clear, they must still be removed. Examples of variations include:
If a customer states they are under 13 years old, we must immediately unsubscribe them without asking for verification
Underage Customers

Criteria for Unsubscribing
Some customers make unsubscribe requests only under certain conditions. Since we cannot guarantee outcomes, we must unsubscribe them immediately without replying
If a customer sends both offensive language and an unsubscribe request, we unsubscribe them immediately without responding
Special Cases
Offensive Language & 
Unsubscribe Request
Conditional Requests

Criteria for Unsubscribing

Special Cases

Exceptions & Edge Cases
When It Might Be Okay to Respond
While most unsubscribe requests require immediate action without a reply, there are rare cases where a response might be okay. However, we must always confirm in #team-deel before responding

Automated Messages

What are Journeys?

A Journey is a structured and automated sequence of text messages designed to guide a customer through a specific experience, process, or interaction with a brand
Journeys typically follow a trigger-based approach. Messages are sent based on specific customer actions
Common Types of Journeys
Welcome
Winback
Loyalty

Abandoned Cart
