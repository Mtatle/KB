     Event Audits

What are Events?
While using the UI, every interaction you have, every click you make is like a signal telling the system what to do. These signals are called Events. However we don't just record these events, we also audit them for unusual behavior
What Events do we Audit?
Blocklist
Escalation
Opt Out
Closed Chat
Double Text
Necessary Reply

 Overview of Events
Unnecessary replies take away time from important texts and can be exploited to artificially boost productivity
Messages sent when the customer's text doesn't require a response
Sample Number:
Up to 3 NECESSARY_REPLY events
Each message costs the brand money. By evaluating we avoid unnecessary messages that could lead to increased expenses
Two or more messages in a row in the same chat without a customer reply in between
Sample Number:
Up to 3 DOUBLE_TEXT events
Improper closes can result in unanswered questions, poor customer experience and lost revenue. It also indicates avoiding chats, which is unacceptable
Closing a conversation when no other action is needed
Sample Number:
Up to 5 CLOSED_CHAT events
Necessary Reply
Double Text
Closed Chat

 Overview of Events
This action is crucial for legal and compliance reasons. Failing to unsubscribe when requested can lead to lawsuits and revenue loss
Unsubscribing a customer permanently stops messages from being sent to them
Sample Number:
1 OPT_OUT event + up to 3 texts
Unneeded escalations indicate that troubleshooting was overlooked or that the customer should have been sent to CS, both of which extend the customer’s wait time
Sends an email with an escalation note and chat history to the brand’s team
Sample Number:
Up to 5 ESCALATE events
We evaluate blocking events to ensure that all customers can reach us. Blocking a customer outside the guidelines can lead to lost revenue
Stops their messages from reaching us while letting them receive our messages
Sample Number:
Up to  3 ADD_TO_BLOCKLIST events

Starting or ending a shift

Reporting connectivity issues 
Every workflow comes in pairs! 
We track key activities such as:
#superhuman-daily is a dedicated Slack channel that serves as a daily checkpoint for all agents (superhumans)
#superhuman-daily
It helps us keep track of schedules and offtime. Understanding how it works is crucial because it directly affects your Agent Behaviors
What is #superhuman-daily?
Why it Matters?

 You should use the In / Out workflows 5 minutes before or up to 5 minutes after your shift starts or ends respectively
In / Out
How It Works
Starting Your Shift ("In")
When you begin your workday, use the "In" workflow to let the team know you are online and available
Ending Your Shift ("Out")
At the end of your workday, use the "Out" workflow to officially log out

Break / Back
You must check if fewer than two people are already on break
If two people are already on break, wait until one of them returns before starting the break
Make sure you’re not taking the break in the last 30 minutes of your shift
When going on a Break:
This prevents understaffing and ensures messages don’t pile up

Break / Back
Once you confirm you can take a break, use the Break Workflow to officially log it
And when you return, use the Back workflow again to mark yourself as back from break

The length of your break time depends on how long your shift is
If you work a single, uninterrupted shift, you get one break
However, if your shifts have a gap in between, then each shift is considered separate, and you get one break per shift
And if you work more than 8 hours consecutively, you can’t take your full break at once you must split it. The maximum break length allowed is 30 minutes

Connectivity Issue / Restored
Connectivity Issues refer to any brief problem that prevents you from accessing the internet, your device, or essential online resources
How It Works
When an issue arises: 
Immediately report it with "Connectivity Issues" 
Once resolved: 
Promptly acknowledge with "Connectivity Restored"
