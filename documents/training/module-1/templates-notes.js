Brand Specific Templates

Brand-Specific templates ALWAYS take precedence over Global templates. If a Brand-Specific template exists that addresses the customer's question or issue, you must use it. This ensures the most accurate and client-approved information is shared. Global templates are only for use in the absence of a relevant Brand-Specific option.

Notes

     Notes

What are Notes? 
Notes are insider tips and guidelines provided by the brand to help you interact correctly with customers. They offer extra context and specific instructions on how to handle conversations
It's crucial to follow them exactly,missing notes will lead to a failed QA audit
Use the notes as a guide to shape your responses, but never copy them directly into your messages to customers
Understanding Notes:

The Structure of Notes
Notes are organized into categories to improve readability and ensure that we can quickly locate relevant information. Since Ctrl + F is not an option, these notes must be read thoroughly to extract necessary details
If you're encountering a brand for the first time, never skim through the notes, take the time to fully understand

 NOT FOR AGENTS

Wording of Notes
Notes are meant to be understood exactly as written, so paying close attention to wording and nuances is crucial
To make notes more concise, we use some standard abbreviations: 
cx = Customer
ESC = Escalation
CS = Customer Support
temp = Template
If a note states “immediately”, that means we don’t troubleshoot at all. Without thinking twice we just follow the instruction if conditions are met
1
If a note specifies a particular tone or phrase, use it exactly as written, even if it doesn’t fit with the tone in the UI
2
Notes take priority over any other information or workflow
3
Key Tips for applying notes:
Every detail matters!

Wording of Notes
"Issues" refer to any technical problems, operational challenges, or any scenario that requires troubleshooting to resolve the problem
This would encompass:
Replacing "Error" with "Issue"
Cancellations & Order Edits
Retroactive Discounts
Code Errors
Account Log In Difficulties
Reward Points Redemption
Discount Redemption
Example: Customer's code is not working; order is late; order arrived damaged

     Promo Stamps

What are Promo Stamps?
Promo Stamps are essential tools for communicating current promotions associated with a brand. They act as a quick-reference, providing key details about ongoing discounts, special offers, or events
There are two primary types
Promo Stamps are our first source of research for promotion inquiries
Coupons
Events

Coupons 
Key elements
They provide detailed information about discount codes available to customers. These codes shouldn’t always be shared with customers. Whether we share the discount code depends on the Promo Stamp description, and our standard workflows 
The coupon code serves as the title (e.g., SAVE20, FREESHIP)
An image of a coupon is displayed at the top left of the stamp

Events
Key elements
Event Promo Stamps highlight upcoming events or brand promotions rather than specific discount codes. They help explain activities that engage customers, and will usually be used as a source of information for answering questions about those events
The name of the event serves as a title(e.g., Spring Sale, Webinar on Health Tips)
An image of a speakeris displayed at the top left of the stamp

Structure of Promo Stamps
Based on the logo and title we can tell which type of stamp it is
These are the details, they usually tell us:
What the promotion does or doesn’t apply to
Any conditions that must be met (like a minimum purchase)
If the promotion is for everyone or specific customers
Other information that can change from brand to brand depending on what they find important
Here we can see whether a promo stamp is active, expired, or upcoming at the time of viewing
To check how long a promotion will last, look at the expiry date
If the promotion hasn’t started yet, you’ll see when it will become active
Even after a promotion expires, the promo stamp stays visible for a while in case a customer mentions it, but it will eventually disappear after a period of inactivity

Best Practices
Verify Status
Always confirm that the promotion is active before sharing
Understand Details
Make sure you understand the applicability and prerequisites to avoid miscommunication
Check Expiry 
Reference the expiry date to provide accurate information 

     Preferences

Concierge Name
What is a Concierge Name?
Never share your real name or personal details with customers

Escalation Preferences
Escalation Preferences are specific types of issues that a brand prefers to be forwarded to them
This includes Escalating, and Sending to CS. Which we opt to use depends on the notes!
What are Escalation Preferences?
Just because an issue falls under escalation preferences, doesn’t mean it should be escalated right away
Follow all existing workflows
Follow all notes and templates
Make every effort to resolve the issue independently
