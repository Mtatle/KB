Forwarding Concerns

Why Do We Forward Concerns?
Unfortunately, not every customer issue can be resolved directly via the UI. In some cases, specialized support is required to resolve complex inquiries. Forwarding customer’s concerns to the brand’s Customer Support (CS) ensures that the right experts handle these cases. This helps us and Brands maintain:
Customer Experience
Customer Retention
Positive Brand Perception

How We Forward Concerns
We forward issues to the client using two methods
Escalations
Sending to CS

What Is an Escalation?
An email is sent to CS immediately with your escalation note and relevant context
Once CS replies, we have a designated Follow-up team that responds in the SMS thread with the resolution, and de-escalates the conversation
Escalate
Email Sent to CS
CS Replies
Follow-up Agent Responds
Escalating a conversation means forwarding the issue to the Customer Support (CS) team through our internal system. The customer remains in the same SMS conversation and will receive a reply there
When we escalate:

What Is “Sending to CS”?
This bypasses our internal escalation system
Once the customer reaches out, CS will reply to them directly, and we will not be part of the resolution process
Forward the Customer
Customer Reaches out to CS
CS Replies
CS Handles All Further Communication
Sending to CS directly means asking the customer to reach out to the support team themselves, usually via email
When we send to CS:

Escalating and Sending to CS
Feature
Escalation
Sending to CS
Who reaches out to CS?
We reach out via internal system
Customer reaches out themselves
Where does the reply go?
In the SMS thread
To customer’s email inbox
Are we involved in the follow-up?
Yes, via Follow-up agent
No, CS replies directly
Experience for the customer
Seamless, handled within chat
Customer must take next action

Reason for These Methods
It gives the customer a seamless concierge experience
We can add detailed context based on our troubleshooting
The CS team receives a clear and structured handoff
If the issue will involve long back-and-forth that’s better handled directly by their team
Sometimes, there are system limitations on our end
Some brands prefer that all support goes through CS directly due to internal workflows
Brands prefer escalations because
Brands prefer sending to CS because
We use both methods for various reasons specific to the client or situation. In most cases, brands prefer us to escalate, so that’s our default way of forwarding issues. However, some issues aren’t suited for escalation. Many brands prefer that most, or all conversations be sent to them directly

When to Troubleshoot
Keep in mind, not every customer query needs to be forwarded. If the notes allow it, troubleshooting within our available resources is always necessary
We only skip troubleshooting if a note specifically says “Immediately” In that case, we follow the instructions in the note right away without doing anything else on our end
Immediately

Sending to CS

Scenarios Which We Send To CS
If a customer issue goes beyond what we can troubleshoot ourselves and needs to be forwarded to the appropriate team, our default option is to escalate. However, there are certain situations where we need to send the customer to CS instead. Those situations are:


Brand notes say to send to CS for specific issues (after troubleshooting or immediately, as stated)
Brand notes


Appropriate Brand-specific templates require contacting CS
Brand-specific templates


Customer insists on emailing or calling
Customer insists


Customer is asking about physical store availability
Physical store availability


Wholesale, job, ambassador, or donation inquiries
Certain inquiries


Images won’t load in the UI after 2 tries, and they're essential for resolution

Brand Notes
If not, the CS template is our default option
Look for specific instructions under “Escalations” or “Send to CS” sections
1
If notes say “No escalations, send everything to CS”, we never escalate!
2
However often notes are issue-specific, e.g., “send to CS for post-purchase issues”. In that case we would only send to CS in those specific scenarios
3
Always Follow the Notes!
When sending to CS
If the notes point out a specific process or template we follow it

Brand-Specific Templates
If a template includes sending the customer to CS and it's suitable for the issue, we should make sure to use it
1
Templates like CED (Cancel/Edit Order) and DMI (Damaged Item) can send to CS even if notes don’t mention it
2
Never use the general CS template if there is a brand-specific template for that situation
3
Rules on Brand-Specific Templates
CED template example
DMI template example

Customer Insists
If a customer insists on emailing CS, provide them with the appropriate template (CS, or brand-specific)
1
If the customer asks for phone support, use the PS (Phone Support) template
2
Adjust the ending of the PS template if it doesn’t match the conversation’s tone or context
3
When the Customer Wants to Contact CS
PS template example

Physical Store Availability
If the customer is asking about stock in a physical store, and the notes allow for it, provide the phone number of the specific store
1
Do not escalate or send to CS unless notes say otherwise
2
An Outlier to the Workflow
Example of a store’s phone number

Specific Inquiries
Use templates like WLS (Wholesale) or AMS (Ambassador/Sponsorship) where available
1
If templates aren’t available and no resources exist in the UI or website
2
Use the general CS template or follow brand notes if they specify a template
3
Wholesale, Sponsorship, Jobs
WLS template
AMS template

Images Won’t Load
After the first failed attempt, ask the customer to provide key details shown in the screenshot that may help us troubleshoot (e.g., the specific error message or items in their cart)
1
If the screenshot is essential for resolution or the customer is unable to provide those key details, ask them to try sending the screenshot one more time

2
If the second attempt also fails, send to CS
3
Customer’s Screenshot Fails to Send

When NOT to Send to CS
Do not redirect to CS if
The situation doesn’t fall under one of the approved redirect reasons 
1
If there are no notes we escalate. That is our default way of forwarding an issue
2
The brand note says “always escalate”
3
Only in the previously mentioned scenarios, we send to CS!

Redirecting Professionally

Customizing
When conveying the redirection to CS, the language should be clear and be empathetic
Always begin by acknowledging the customer’s concern, showing understanding of their situation
Even if it’s not written in the template, empathy is really important. If a customer is facing an issue or any kind of inconvenience, we should always apologize and show that we understand how they feel
Make sure to adjust the template if parts of it don’t fully match the context of the chat
The message should feel like it's from within the brand, not as if we're simply passing the customer along

Escalating

Required Research
Before proceeding with an escalation, it is essential to exhaust all available resources
Review the help center, FAQ, and brand-specific policy pages
Check internal brand notes, previous interactions, and templates available in the UI
Search for potential solutions using the brand’s website or even credible external sources
1
2
We need to troubleshoot, even if the previous agent was gearing the conversation towards an escalation
3

Types of Escalations
These involve inquiries before an order is placed; such as questions about product availability, pricing discrepancies, discount details, or policy clarifications.
Escalations can be divided into two categories
Pre-Purchase Escalations
Post-Purchase Escalations
These occur after an order has been made. Examples include issues with delivery, damaged products, returns, or retroactive discount requests.

Required Information

Pre-Purchase Escalations
Before escalating a pre-purchase issue, always gather essential details that help the merchant understand the context
Do not include personal information like order number or email unless:
The issue is related to account access, password resets, rewards, etc.
→ In those cases, the email address is required
Always include
Follow any brand-specific instructions in the templates or notes
Tip
A clear summary of the issue
Product name or link, if applicable
Screenshots of error messages or relevant pages

Post-Purchase Escalations
For post-purchase escalations, we must include key customer and order details so the CS team can assist effectively
Always include
Follow any brand-specific instructions in the templates or notes
For subscription changes, even if there is an order visible in the UI, we don’t need to ask for an order number. The email address is sufficient
Tip
Order number
Email address
A summary of the issue
Photos or screenshots, especially for issues like damaged or wrong items

Personal Information

Sharing Personal Information
To protect customer privacy and data security, we must not confirm personal information ourselves
Instead, we ask customers to provide their own details
Sharing personal information is considered sharing anything which shows the customers
Order numbers, full names, tracking numbers/links, and general information about the status of their order are not considered personal information, and can be shared directly with the customer
         Email address
         Phone number
        Shipping or billing address
 Credit card information

Why This Step Matters
We don’t share personal information without first confirming it with the customer, even if we can see it in our system, because it helps protect their privacy and prevent potential data breaches
Confirming ensures that we’re speaking to the actual account holder and not someone else who may have gained access to the conversation
What might go wrong if we don’t confirm?
Since this is reviewed during QA auditing, not sticking to the workflow might cause the conversation to fail and get a zero-tolerance flag

Confirming Personal Information
Ask the customer to share their email address
Confirm the order number (if visible in the UI)
→ If not visible, ask them to provide it as well
Ask the customer to share secondary information: 
Full Name
Shipping Address
If we need to generally share personal information that we can see on our end, we only need to confirm the customer’s email address or secondary information
If we need to escalate a post-purchase issue
1
If the customer is unable to provide both their email and order number tied to their order
2

Depending on whether it’s a pre-purchase or post purchase issue

Click the Escalate button or use the shortcut Shift + E
A pop-up will appear where we enter a summary of the issue (do not copy and paste the customer’s message - paraphrase and summarize instead).
For post-purchase issues, include order details (order number and email).
Click the yellow “Escalate” button


Gather all the required information

How to Escalate

Initiate the escalation

1
2

Send a message confirming that we’ve forwarded their issue to our team and will get back to them soon
Send the message only after escalating, or the system may unassign you from the conversation
A green banner at the top of the conversation will show once an escalation has been completed. It will display the agent’s name and the summary.
How to Escalate

Inform the customer

Confirmation of escalation

4

Responses from brands are handled by the Escalation/Follow-Up Team, so we do not need to reply to the customer ourselves.
1
When an escalation is resolved, we’ll see a message like: “Thanks for your patience, I just heard back from the team –” followed by the brand’s info. These responses appear as normal messages from a Concierge agent but will address the escalated issue
2
Once resolved, the conversation is de-escalated, and the green banner will disappear.

Escalation Response

Pending Conversations

Conversation Already Escalated
Do’s
Don’ts
Empathize with the customer’s frustration

“They’ll refund you soon”
Promise specific outcomes or timelines

“Unfortunately, I haven’t heard back yet...”
Don’t skip the direct apology

“As I said before…”
Sound cold, defensive
Reassure them that the CS team will get back to them as soon as possible
Remain calm, polite, and focused on resolution
If a conversation has been escalated or redirected to Customer Support (CS) and the customer replies back upset or frustrated

Conversation Already Escalated
Prepare TextBlaze templates for each situation. Templates help ensure professionalism and save time while still sounding personal
To handle these efficiently
Asking when they will receive a reply / General anger
Threatening legal action / Extreme anger
The most common customer replies after escalation are:

Delayed Replies From CS
If a customer asks about a delayed reply, and it’s related to an escalation, we should let them know that they will receive a reply as soon as possible and show empathy. However, if they reached out to CS, we also need to suggest that they check their spam and promotions folders in case the response was filtered there
What can the agent improve on here?
What do you love about this message?

Legal Threats / Extreme Anger
For legal threats or extreme anger, it’s important to be especially careful in how we respond. We need to show that we understand the seriousness of the situation and make sure our response includes our strongest show of empathy to help calm the customer and mitigate the situation
What do you love about this message?
What can the agent improve on here?

Pending Escalations
We escalate the conversation
Politely redirect the customer to email CS directly
Why? Because the CS team may have tried contacting them, or their system may not have received the customer’s details properly
Customer hears nothing, and replies back
If it’s been over 2 days and the customer still hasn’t heard back:
We redirect the customer to CS 

Key Reminder
Even for conversations that have an escalation pending, we always need to provide a resolution to the customer when it’s possible to do so
Check if you can still troubleshoot
Ask questions to gather more detail when necessary, if you think the issue is resolvable
If a conversation has already been escalated, or the previous agent was preparing to escalate it, always remember to:
If another agent has already escalated the issue, but you believe it is still solvable, it is okay to de-escalate. We will review when it’s okay to de-escalate in detail shortly
Keep in Mind

De-Escalations

Conversation Already Escalated
This action is not taken lightly and must follow specific rules to ensure consistency and customer satisfaction
When to De-Escalate
Re-Escalations
However there are reasons where you may need to de-escalate, so we will cover
De-escalating a conversation means removing the escalation banner and signaling that the issue no longer needs to be handled by the Customer Support (CS) team

When to De-Escalate
You can de-escalate a conversation only when
The customer returns and confirms that their issue has been resolved
1
We’re correcting an unwarranted escalation and realize we have the resources to help
2
We were supposed to direct them to CS instead
3

What About Re-Escalation?
Provides new information about the pending escalation
Has a new issue that needs to be escalated
In cases where the customer
We can proceed by re-escalating the conversation!
The workflow for re-escalations is as follows
1
De-escalate the original escalation
2
Include the original escalation notes to maintain continuity
3
Clearly add any new information or updates the customer has provided
4
Continue to Escalate the conversation again allowing the Customer Support team to have full context

Inactive Escalations
To handle these situations, follow-up agents review old escalations weekly. If there’s no longer any unresolved issue, they will de-escalate to clean up the queue
If a customer replies to those de-escalated conversations wanting a reply, and there’s clear history of the original escalation 
1
Do not escalate again, redirect them to CS! 
2
Some conversations will not receive a reply within the designated time, for various reasons
