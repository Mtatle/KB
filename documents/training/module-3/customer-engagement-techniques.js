Message Composition

Overview
Concise and Complete
Avoiding Jargon
Since these are SMS messages, we need to write them in a short, clear, and conversational style that fits texting!
 Every word you choose shapes the customer’s perception of your competence and care. In this section, we’ll explore how to keep messages clear, concise, and warm, avoiding overly formal or robotic language, while adapting your tone to match each customer’s style
Avoiding Dismissive Language

Concise and Complete
Next Step or Question
“Let me know how it goes!”
Provide only the context the customer needs to understand why:
 “You need to log into your account to change your address.”
Provide Context
Lead with the solution
“Happy to help! To update your shipping address, follow this link: []”
Long, winding replies can bury your solution and frustrate the customer. Keep every message focused on one main idea and limit yourself to two or three short sentences. Start with the answer, follow with any necessary context, then end with clear next steps or a closing question

Avoid Jargon
Internal Jargon
 Swap formal or industry‐only phrases for clear, everyday language that customers know
Legalese & Policies
“please be advised”
 Industry terms and formal legalese distance you from the customer. Words like “please be advised” or “pursuant to policy” force them to translate your meaning
“just so you know”
“pursuant to guidelines”
“escalate to the appropriate team”
“check with our team”
“SKU”
“product number”
“under our policy”

Dismissive Language
Hold off on farewell phrases or quick sign-offs like:“Have a great day”until you’ve confirmed the solution
Avoid abrupt closing
Clarifying questions that help troubleshoot:“Can you send me a screenshot of the error?”
Instead ask
Don’t say mid-conversation
“Let me know if you need anything else.”“Hope this helps!
Phrases that sound like conversation‑enders can make customers feel as if you’re brushing them off. During troubleshooting, keep your tone curious and open. Save closers for the very end
These lines cut the dialogue short and give the impression you’re ready to move on.
Questions like these keep the conversation flowing and uncover the root cause
Keeping the dialogue open until resolution reassures customers you’re fully committed to helping

Empathy

Overview
Acknowledging
How to use empathy
 Read carefully to pinpoint the core issue and its impact
 Express genuine empathy that reflects you’ve heard and value their feelings
In every support interaction, customers bring their feelings with them—frustration, confusion, even relief. Acknowledging those emotions validates the customer’s experience and builds a bridge of empathy. In this section, we’ll look at how to recognize feelings in text and respond in a way that calms tension and deepens trust
Resolving
 Provide the exact support needed to address their problem effectively
Understanding

Why Use Empathy
Why Use Empathy
Why This Matters
 Recognizing their disappointment shows we respect their time and trust. Validating their feelings lowers tension and makes them more open to the solution we’ll offer next
Why This Matters
By sharing in their excitement, we strengthen the customer’s positive impression of our brand and encourage them to engage further—turning a simple purchase into a memorable experience
Excitement
Examples
Putting yourself in the customer’s shoes, feeling their highs and lows, builds genuine human connection. When we share in their joy, we reinforce positive experiences and deepen loyalty; when we acknowledge their frustration, we validate their feelings and create space for calm, constructive resolutions
Disappointment

Understanding
“I’m thrilled!” “Why isn’t this working?!” reveal excitement, confusion, or frustration
Context clues
Emotive words & punctuation
What to Look for
Before you can help, you need to feel what your customer is feeling. That means reading every word they write, spotting clues to their mood (frustration, excitement, confusion) and using those signals to shape your response
Tone & pacing
Order delays, timing, past issues tell you why they’re reaching out now
Short, clipped sentences vs. enthusiastic exclamation points guide how formal or friendly you should be

Acknowledging
Start every reply with a sincere nod to their situation! Before jumping into details or solutions. Whether they’re asking a quick question, can’t find a product, or reporting an issue, a heartfelt expression of understanding sets the right tone
It's easier to make clients feel like you're focused on them and their concerns as a person when you humanize the dialogue. When it comes to delighting customers, compassion and optimism both count for a lot. That said, here are ways to personalize our responses and deliver empathy through our messages.

Lead with Empathy
Match Their Mood
 Adjust your response to how they feel:

Frustrated? Offer a genuine apology and reassurance

Confused? Provide clear, patient guidance

Excited? Share in their enthusiasm and celebrate with them

Acknowledging
I just opened my new headphones and the sound is incredible!
Use a calm, explanatory tone; acknowledge with“I know that ‘invalid code’ message can be confusing,” then start troubleshooting
Use calm, validating language that names their frustration “I understand how upsetting this delay is” before moving into troubleshooting
My package was supposed to arrive three days ago and there’s still no update!
When you align both your words and tone with the customer’s emotion, your response feels in sync with how they’re feeling. Mirroring their mood builds rapport instantly and shows you’re truly listening
Here’s how to match various moods:
Frustration
Match Their Mood
Confusion
Excitement
I tried applying my discount code at checkout, but it keeps saying ‘invalid code.’??
Share in their enthusiasm with upbeat, positive language“That’s fantastic to hear!”to reinforce their joy and deepen the connection

Resolving
Once you’ve helped, check in: “Does this meet your needs?” or “Is there anything else you’d like help with?”
Keep customers informed of what you’re checking and when they can expect updates! No one likes being left in the dark
If the exact item or feature isn’t available, suggest the closest match or workaround that fits their needs
Tap into the UI, knowledge base, and credible external sources to find solutions before the customer even asks
After you’ve truly connected (mirroring the customer’s emotion and validating their experience) your focus shifts to delivering proactive, tailored support. Resolving isn’t just about fixing what’s broken; it’s about anticipating needs and using every resource at your fingertips to make the customer feel genuinely cared for
Leverage every resource
Offer tailored alternatives
Be transparently proactive
Confirm resolution
By moving from empathy into action—anticipating next questions, presenting clear options, and staying one step ahead—you transform a simple support interaction into an exceptional, worry-free experience

Handling Delays
When to Apologize
We are the first reply of the day, and the customer is waiting for a response for over 20 minutes
Customer has sent multiple follow-ups ("hello?", "any update?")
You’re providing an escalation update after an internal delay
What to Say
"My apologies for the delay in getting back to you!"
"So sorry for the wait! I'm just getting to your message now..."
“I apologize for the delay in getting this resolved. My team is still looking into it.”

Tips for Showing Empathy
Say Thanks Whenever Customers Share Information
Always Show Eagerness to Help
Small gestures create big impact. By weaving in gratitude, genuine eagerness, and timely apologies, you turn routine support into moments that customers remember
Apologize for Any Inconvenience
Use active language that signals you’re ready and willing:
“I’m more than happy to help!”
Keep your tone upbeat and solution-focused, even if the issue is complex
Whenever a customer takes extra steps (providing order numbers, screenshots, or detailed descriptions) acknowledge it:

“Thank you for sending your screenshot!”
Whenever a customer experiences any disruption, whether caused by our system, a carrier delay, or even their own setup, we offer a sincere apology:

“I’m sorry this has caused you trouble!”

Dry Empathy
While well-intentioned, these lines lack specificity and can come across as dry
Dry Empathy Statements
These phrases shift blame onto the customer’s feelings or make the apology conditional
Cut-Out Apologies
Generic apologies and bland empathy lines can actually damage rapport, customers hear them as scripted and insincere
These are two of the most common pitfalls so you can replace them with genuine empathy and action
“I’m sorry you feel that way.”
“Sorry for any inconvenience.”
“My apologies if this caused trouble.”
“I understand your frustration.”
“I know how you feel.”
“That must be upsetting.”

Non‑Apology Statements

Overview
How to Respond
Genuine Apologies
Why They Don’t Work
Non‑apology statements look like apologies but actually shift blame or invalidate the customer’s feelings. Phrases such as “I’m sorry you feel that way” or “Sorry if you were offended” places the focus on the customer’s reaction rather than acknowledging any real fault or issue on our part
Non‑Apology Statements

Why They Don’t Work
Rather than calming frustration, they often inflame it—customers feel dismissed, not supported
Erodes Trust
These statements avoid admitting any responsibility, so customers hear no genuine empathy or commitment to fix the issue
Lack of Ownership
“I’m sorry you feel that way” implies the problem lies in the customer’s feelings, not our product or process
Non‑apology statements look like apologies but actually shift blame or invalidate the customer’s feelings. Phrases such as “I’m sorry you feel that way” or “Sorry if you were offended” place the onus on the customer’s reaction rather than acknowledging any real fault or issue on our part
Blame Shift

Genuine Apologies
Genuine apologies are honest, sincere acknowledgments of a mistake or inconvenience, showing the customer that we truly care about their experience
“I’m sorry you feel that way.”
“Sorry if that caused you any trouble.”
“If you were offended, I’m sorry.”
Blames the customer’s reaction
Suggests trouble may not really exist
Makes the apology conditional on their feelings
“I understand how upsetting this has been for you.”
“I apologize for the inconvenience you’ve experienced.”
“I’m sorry our message came across the wrong way.”
Non‑Apology Statement
Better Alternative
Why It Falls Flat

How To Respond
“I'm reaching out to my team! I'll update you as soon as I hear back.”
“I’m truly sorry to hear that the order hasn’t arrived on time.”
“I realize this shipping delay disrupted your weekend plans.”
Explain exactly how the customer was affected
Combine understanding of the feeling with a sincere apology for the shortcoming
Tell them what you will do and how the issue can be resolved
Avoid conditional language such as “I’m sorry if you feel frustrated,” own the error with a direct apology
Acknowledge the Issue

Personalization

Why Do We Personalize?
Personalizing
Every interaction is an opportunity to show customers they’re more than just a ticket number. By acknowledging their history and preferences, you build immediate rapport and trust. When a customer feels seen they’re far more likely to engage positively 
Active Reading
We’ll focus on 3 main sections that help us understand what personalizations looks like, and how we can personalize our responses
Being Conversational

Active Reading

Why Active Reading Matters
 Before you can resolve any issue, the customer must feel understood. Active reading—paraphrasing, summarizing, and asking focused questions—demonstrates that you’ve fully absorbed their message
This practice reduces unnecessary back‑and‑forth, prevents missteps, and reassures customers that you’re invested in solving their problem correctly the first time
How active reading looks in conversations
The customer:
Has an order that’s delayed
Is explicitly angry
Proper response:
“I’m sorry about the constant delays! I completely understand how frustrating it is when you don’t receive your order…”

Personalizing

Info From the UI
Example of a customer with 
intent to purchase
The UI is rich with details: past orders, browsing history. Use these data points as natural conversation starters
Past Orders
Browsing History
Examples of how to use this information
“I can see that you ordered some outfits recently, what do you think of these caps that are a customer favorite! []”
“I’ve noticed you’ve been checking our apparel! What do you think about our latest arrivals of t-shirts here: []”

Personalized Phrases
“…I hope they were a great match! ...”
“…I’m more than happy to help you find pants that go well with them!”
“I noticed you ordered some shirts recently…”
Connect
Acknowledge
 To turn data into dialogue, follow a simple structure: acknowledge the detail, connect it to today’s question, then offer help
Help
This three‑step pattern feels warm and genuine and never forced because it mirrors how you’d speak to a returning friend

Clarifying Questions
“Have you tried entering the code using a different browser or device to see if the same error appears?”
Troubleshooting
“Are you looking for a fridge that's more focused on storage space, or something smaller for tighter spaces?
You can also take a look at our best selling fridges here: [link]”
Funneling Questions
“Just to clarify, is this the product you’re looking for: [link]?”
General Clarification
 Focused questions fill in the blanks without overwhelming the customer. Precede them with softeners like “just so I’m clear” or “to make sure I understand”:
They help ensure you fully understand the customer's situation before offering a solution, preventing misunderstandings and saving time for both sides

Being Conversational

Conversational Tone
That balance keeps things human without losing focus on the solution
 A conversational style lowers barriers and makes customers feel comfortable. Start with their name, use everyday language, and keep sentences short. Remember to keep our messages SMS-friendly, avoid overwhelming the customer with unnecessary details
Notice the mix of 
Friendliness: “great to see you back” 
Context: “new earbuds”
 Assistance: “help you find a cover”

“Hi Alex! Great to see you back! I hope your new earbuds arrived okay. I’d love to help you find a cover for them! What do you think about this:                  


Troubleshooting
Even a short update helps the customer feel seen and supported
After troubleshooting always let the customer know you’re actively checking on their issue and what steps you have taken. Letting customers know you're actively working on their issue builds trust and shows engagement
We acknowledged the customer’s message
Clearly stated we’re actively working on the issue
Set expectations for the code
“I’m sorry for any inconvenience. I just checked the code on my end and I’m seeing a few things that might be causing the issue…“

Connecting with Customers
The very first moments of a support interaction set the tone. When a customer reports a problem, start by confirming you’ve seen and replicated it. This shared experience builds immediate rapport and shows you’re fully invested in finding a solution together
When resolving an issue we need to connect emotionally and show understanding. To accomplish this we should:
Acknowledge clearly that you replicated the problem
Be transparent but positive
Take ownership without blaming
Set expectations for what happens next

“I’m really sorry about that! I tested the code as well and got the same error. Let me check with the team on this!...”


Consistent Voice
While messaging a customer we need to create a seamless, personal experience, every customer should feel like they’re talking to one person, even if agents change
Sound Like One Person
Everything previous agents mentioned is your responsibility
Never reference the existence of other agents
Reference Past Messages
Acknowledge earlier issues or context
“Thanks for following up about…”
Seamless Experience
Don’t let the customer feel the switch
Pick up the thread smoothly, don’t restart the conversation
“Sorry about that, my honest mistake…

How to Stay Conversational
DOs
DON’Ts
Mention one or two genuine data points (“I see you’ve been browsing our sneakers”)
Use the customer’s name early in your reply (if it’s available)
Ask a brief follow‑up question to keep the dialogue alive
Overwhelm with every detail the UI shows—too many facts and feels robotic
Rely on generic statements (“we value your business”) that don’t reference specifics
Slip into jargon or overly formal language that erodes the conversational feel

Clarity

Why Clarity Matters
Clarity in customer support means providing information in a way that is understandable, grammatically correct, and natural. Clear communication is key in customer support, as it leads to:
Ensures that customers fully understand the solutions
Projects competence and reliability
Customers who feel heard and clearly understood
Efficiency
Trust
Loyalty

Common Pitfalls
The details of your order needs to be confirmed before shipment.

This often happens, when templates don’t align with the context of the message. So always double-check!
They sound similar but do not carry the same meaning. Common examples are (Your, You’re), (They’re, Their, There), (Than, Then)
"Rest assured" is already a complete phrase. We need to avoid adding unnecessary language that is already conveyed in our message

Awkward Phrasing
Overusing Phrases in the Wrong Context
Overcomplicating Explanations
General Awkward Phrasing
I’m sorry about that! Sure. I’m happy to help! You can find the item here: 
The first fridge offers a bigger kind of storage capacity, especially if you tend to have more stuff to put in like groceries and leftovers.
I am here only to help you.
I’m sorry for any confusion, you can find the item you’re looking for here:
The first fridge is bigger, and a better option if you store a lot of groceries.
I’m here to help!
This usually stems from overusing short templated responses when they do not provide any value. We need to always keep our messages easy to follow
Longer responses aren’t always better, try to strike the balance between clarity, and personalization
Misplacing certain words can unintentionally sound defensive or awkward. We always try our best to construct messages that suit an American audience

American Phrasing
Avoid using overly formal or uncommon words, even if they’re grammatically correct
American English uses get and let frequently
Stick to U.S. English spelling and common phrases
Here are clear, practical tips for avoiding awkward or irregular phrasing when writing to an American audience
Use “Get” and “Let” Naturally
Use Everyday, Vocabulary
Use American Spelling
Do inform me once you try again.
Let me know how it goes.
Enjoy your holiday!
Vacation (not holiday, unless it's a national holiday)
Kindly revert back to us at your earliest convenience.
Please get back to us when you can.
Bonus!

Typos
Pressing the Wrong Key
Irregular Capitalization
Improper Copy-pasting
Let me knoe if you need any help.
The dress, Unfortunately, isn’t in stock at the moment.
No problem, lmk;
Let me know if you need any help.
The dress, unfortunately, isn’t in stock at the moment.
No problem, and let me know if you have any more questions.
A simple mistake but one of the reasons why proofreading is so important. The small things matter
This usually happens when we use a template that starts with a capital letter, even though it's in the middle of a sentence
Sometimes templates don’t autofill correctly if we miss a letter, and if we’re rushing, it’s easy to forget to double-check. Always take a moment to proofread!

Run-on Sentences
Not Separating Ideas
Skipping Question Marks
Connecting Sentences
We understand you're frustrated we are looking into the issue.
Have you tried using a different browser, that often helps resolve any issues.
Your return was approved however we still need your shipping receipt.
We understand you're frustrated. We are looking into the issue.
Have you tried using a different browser? That often helps resolve any issues.
Your return was approved, however, we still need your shipping receipt.
After each idea, ask yourself: is this a new point? If yes, separate it with a period or a connecting word like and, but, or so
After a question always add a question mark. When layering a sentence it’s easy to forget
When using a word to connect two sentences, it should be set off with commas

How to Maintain Clarity
Over time, you'll notice patterns in the types of mistakes you make. Keeping a small personal list of these and checking it weekly helps you continuously improve
Reading your text aloud forces you to slow down and helps you hear mistakes you might miss while skimming silently
Always use templates available at your disposal. Templates, when pre-checked for clarity and correctness, are a foolproof way to type faster without needing to double-check every detail
Technology can be a great ally. Tools like Grammarly instantly highlight potential mistakes and suggest corrections, saving you time and improving your accuracy
Use grammar-check tools
Make use of templated responses
Re-read your response aloud
Build a personal list of frequent mistakes
