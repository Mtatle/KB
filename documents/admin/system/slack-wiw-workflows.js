     Slack Workflows

Starting or ending a shift 
Taking breaks 
Reporting connectivity issues 
Every workflow comes in pairs! 
We track key activities such as:
#superhuman-daily is a dedicated Slack channel that serves as a daily checkpoint for all agents (superhumans)
#superhuman-daily
It helps us keep track of schedules and offtime. Understanding how it works is crucial because it directly affects your Agent Behaviors
What is #superhuman-daily?
Why it Matters?

 You should use the In / Out workflows 5 minutes before or up to 5 minutes after your shift starts or ends respectively
In / Out
How It Works
Starting Your Shift ("In")
When you begin your workday, use the "In" workflow to let the team know you are online and available
Ending Your Shift ("Out")
At the end of your workday, use the "Out" workflow to officially log out

Break / Back
You must check if fewer than two people are already on break
If two people are already on break, wait until one of them returns before starting the break
Make sure you’re not taking the break in the last 30 minutes of your shift
When going on a Break:
This prevents understaffing and ensures messages don’t pile up

Break / Back
Once you confirm you can take a break, use the Break Workflow to officially log it
And when you return, use the Back workflow again to mark yourself as back from break

The length of your break time depends on how long your shift is
If you work a single, uninterrupted shift, you get one break
However, if your shifts have a gap in between, then each shift is considered separate, and you get one break per shift
And if you work more than 8 hours consecutively, you can’t take your full break at once you must split it. The maximum break length allowed is 30 minutes

Connectivity Issue / Restored
Connectivity Issues refer to any brief problem that prevents you from accessing the internet, your device, or essential online resources
How It Works
When an issue arises: 
Immediately report it with "Connectivity Issues" 
Once resolved: 
Promptly acknowledge with "Connectivity Restored"
